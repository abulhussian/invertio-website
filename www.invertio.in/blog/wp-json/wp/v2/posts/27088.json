The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute developed CMMI. The model\u2019s five maturity levels increase organizational capability and rigor. Here are the five maturity levels:<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">1. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Initial<\/strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aNew businesses go through an unpredictable environment that leads to increased risks and inefficiency at this stage.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">2. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Managed<\/strong>&#8211; At this level, companies have formalized their software engineering practices with documented policies &amp; procedures.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">3. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Defined<\/strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aThese companies have documented plans for improvement at this stage.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">4. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Quantitatively Managed<\/strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aCompanies have measurement systems that quantify how well they\u2019re meeting performance targets in the project management\u2019s six dimensions (quality attributes) in process areas.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">5. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Optimizing<\/strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aCompanies must establish metrics and quantitative goals for each maturity level before progressing to the next one. You may outsource some aspects of your software development process at this stage if you don\u2019t have the staff available internally.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The final stage occurs when an organization has achieved all other stages, has established its own metrics system from within, and can reliably assess its progress in improving productivity, efficiency and effectiveness over time through iterative activities.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits_of_CMMI_in_Software_Development\"><\/span>Benefits of CMMI in Software Development<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a complete process improvement model for developing, maintaining, and acquiring software systems. It is built upon eight capability areas:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Planning, organizing, staffing, directing &amp; controlling the work<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Analysis &amp; design<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Implementation and testing<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Operation &amp; maintenance<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Evaluation of results<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Problem detection<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Diagnosis<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Correction<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">CMMI provides a structured set of processes that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of any organization. CMMI is an invaluable asset to any organization that seeks to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance performance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One way to ensure the success of CMMI is by training employees on how it works so they can take ownership of its implementation.
