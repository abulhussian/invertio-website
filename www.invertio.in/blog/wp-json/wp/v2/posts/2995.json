Even Sometimes you do not understand if you wanted freelancers or outsourcing companies. Now, the top freelancing companies are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/\">Upwork<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guru.com\/\">Guru<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancer.com\/?t=c&amp;utm_expid=294858-459.M7_txb98QLOpUxY1sHl9TQ.1\">Freelancer<\/a>. Hence, let&#8217;s see who wins in the battle among\u00a0 Upwork vs Guru vs Freelancer vs Outsourcing Companies.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Freelancer\"><\/span><b>Freelancer<br \/>\n<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s start with Freelancer. It is quite a popular platform used by freelancers and businesses alike. The site has got over 14 million registered users. It is a little different from other platforms as it charges both the business owners and freelancers for the projects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is an entry-level fee of $3 or 3% ( whichever is greater) &#8211; of the project cost, for the hiring company. The basic rates, on the other hand, for freelancers range from $3-5 or 3-5% whichever is greater. Before upgrading to a paid membership, a freelancer can bid for only up to 8 proposals\/month.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"width: 100%; float: left; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/freelancer-logo.png.webp\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4016\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/freelancer-logo.png.webp\" alt=\"freelancer-logo\" width=\"410\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/freelancer-logo.png.webp 410w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/freelancer-logo-300x125.png.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The platform provides a desktop tracking app for tracking hours spent on the project by the freelancer. This is a deterrent for many freelancers looking to bid on fixed-cost projects, rather than hourly ones. The platform also has a membership fee for businesses wishing to promote their projects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are a freelancer and have been inactive for a while, the platform will charge you a fee for being \u2018inactive\u2019. It also charges its users for converting money from one currency to another.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Upwork\"><\/span><b>Upwork<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Upwork is a relatively new freelancing platform, as we all know that it\u2019s the merged entity after the Elance and Odesk merger.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The quality of freelancers on Upwork is observed to be higher than the other freelancing platforms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"width: 100%; float: left; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-logo-1200.png.webp\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4014\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-logo-1200.png.webp\" alt=\"upwork logo\" width=\"700\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-logo-1200.png.webp 1201w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-logo-1200-300x158.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-logo-1200.png-768x404.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-logo-1200.png-1024x538.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-logo-1200.png-480x252.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you thoroughly look at the Upwork desktop site you will find that it ensures all kinds of spam accounts are promptly deleted, so the users on the site remain genuine. Upwork provides a decent skill verification process to ensure one can hire freelancers who are reasonably skilled at the work they do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Upwork desktop site has a fairly easy registration process and requires some basic details like an email address. Upwork does not allow users to share their direct contact details with their users. The platform has a 5-star rating system and each project delivered satisfactorily, gets a chance to be rated by the buyer of the service.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Upwork charges its clients a fee of 10% of the project cost while it is completely free for freelancers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/application-development?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blogbanner&amp;utm_medium=banner\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5538 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Web-Mobile.png.webp\" alt=\"Web &amp; Mobile app development\" width=\"750\" height=\"138\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Web-Mobile.png.webp 750w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Web-Mobile-300x55.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Web-Mobile.png-480x88.webp 480w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Web-Mobile-600x110.png.webp 600w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Web-Mobile-150x28.png.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Guru\"><\/span><b>Guru<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is another freelancing platform that is popular with freelancers of today.

These companies provide experienced resources, depending upon the requirements of the project.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The major advantage of such companies is that they do not charge a commission on the project cost, the way freelancing platforms do. Such companies provide fixed-cost resources who work on your project and ensure successful delivery. The resources are available for discussion and feedback, just like full-time employees.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hiring company also gets access to timesheets and daily reporting, ensuring that the productivity is according to the desired standards. Businesses find it really hard to find the most suitable candidates for their projects, on freelancing platforms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They keep posting jobs, only to find the least fit resources bidding for it and not completing the work as desired.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Flexiple\"><\/span>Flexiple<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/flexiple.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flexiple<\/a> is a network of pre-vetted freelance software developers &amp; designers.
