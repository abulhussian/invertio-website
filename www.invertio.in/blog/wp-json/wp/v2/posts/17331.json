Several new web technologies have brought many recent changes to this domain. But as we all know \u201cOld is Gold\u201d.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you are thinking right!\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even having various new web ruler technologies, businesses are still relying on some old yet strong web technologies. Here, I am talking about two master web technologies, i.e. PHP and WordPress.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People had discussed a lot about them. You can find many articles discussing PHP pros and cons, advantages of PHP, <a href=\"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/php-or-nodejs-top-tips-to-pick-the-right-technology-for-your-project-0lh31bs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PHP vs NodeJS<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/ecommerce-cms\/best-cms-tools-to-start-a-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress vs Joomla<\/a>, PHP vs WordPress war, etc. But this is not the answer to all your queries.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the best between PHP and WordPress would consume your time, money, and your manual efforts too. In this fast-paced world, you can save these things by considering a well-formed piece like this.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we will look at some pointers profoundly and develop the desired result of the war between \u201cPHP and WordPress\u201d. Let\u2019s begin the discussion with a small brief on both web technologies.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"PHP_Its_Frameworks\"><\/span>PHP &amp; Its Frameworks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s first understand \u201cwhat a PHP framework is?\u201d. You will surely need a good knowledge of coding for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/web-application-development?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=phpwordpress-17331-s11&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> website development.<\/a> PHP itself is a web programming language that helps you in developing awesome websites, web applications, and other tools with ease. It is the language that empowers WordPress, so it&#8217;s more than adequate for building your website.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As for a &#8220;PHP web framework&#8221;, you can think of this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-stack-for-your-web-application\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web development language<\/a> as a flexible template. You will often find that certain powerful functions are involved within a framework, based on the various philosophies and goals of the creator, although that is not a prerequisite.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PHP web development frameworks provide you with the necessary elements and act as the bare-bones foundation to build a website. But this is not a complete solution for a full-fledged website. You may require to hire PHP developers to accomplish this task as they will use their web development skills.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This difference can help you in making a decision between PHP and WordPress.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/hire-developers\/hire-php-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=phpvswp_17331_s11&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Note: A WordPress CMS does not require much technical knowledge for developing and maintaining a website. On the other hand, PHP requires great knowledge for developing a great website.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have a look at some popular PHP web development frameworks below:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.

The ease of use of the chosen platform will play an important role in its efficiency and the effectiveness of the final product.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/popular-php-frameworks-to-watch-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PHP framework <\/a>is basically designed for developers, dealing with a level-programming language low, the UI\/UX is usually pretty basic for them. On the other hand, a CMS like WordPress serves as a low technical entry point for developing a website, attaining an attractive graphical user interface (GUI) is key. Hence, a CMS like WordPress will be ideal if you need clarity during development and use.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: WordPress is the winner in the war of PHP vs WordPress.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_High_Security\"><\/span>2) High Security<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Untitled-design-19.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Source: slideshare.net<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Question: Which platform between WordPress and PHP will provide great security to apps?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Security, being the primary concern of all website owners, represents a huge difference between PHP and the WordPress CMS. In case, it fails to secure your site properly, regardless of your goals, it can result in sensitive data leaks into the wrong hands.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, this could lead to all kinds of financial and legal issues. This makes choosing the best between a PHP or CMS framework more than a matter of preference as it will directly affect the success of your brand or business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, a WordPress CMS could be considered more secure, as the inherent security can be built into the platform itself. However, a PHP framework is considered a lower-level solution in terms of security. Here, you can essentially add the security features you need into the basic functionality of your site.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: PHP is the winner in the war of PHP vs WordPress.<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Constant_Upgrades\"><\/span>3) Constant Upgrades<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Untitled-design-16.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Question: Which provides quick and constant upgrades in the war of WordPress vs PHP?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As we know that the Internet is a constantly evolving technology. And, we are keen to get constant updates and bug fixes that keep the wheel spinning efficiently and also help website visitors stay safe.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You will often find that a CMS like WordPress will receive near-perpetual updates to add new features, bug fixings, improve security, and work on the user feedback. For instance, WordPress maintains a roadmap that describes the platform&#8217;s main release history, which is very active.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, a PHP framework does not usually update as consistently as WordPress does. This is because of the responsibility for improving various functionalities and security features with the help of a developer who works directly with the language. However, this does not make it less stable in theory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: WordPress is the winner in the war of PHP vs WordPress.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/hire-developers\/hire-wordpress-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=phpvswp_17331_s11&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/woardpress-developers.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_More_Flexible\"><\/span>4) More Flexible\u00a0<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Untitled-design-20.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Source: Search Engine Journal<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Question: Which one between WordPress and PHP offers more flexibility and custom development options?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People often argue that flexibility is not always a primary concern, especially when you have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve with the site you are developing. In those cases, choosing a niche-specific solution would be more suitable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But consider many third-party services you can use, especially if you are running an e-commerce website. For instance, order processing, marketing platforms, and many other tools and features should be seamlessly integrated into your chosen site-building solution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A CMS generally offers many options, and this is particularly true when it comes to the WordPress platform. However, the adaptability for those with specific requirements is usually less than that provided by a PHP framework. As with security, a PHP framework offers a broader scope for what it can accomplish, a great thanks to its low-level architecture.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: WordPress is the winner in the war of WordPress vs PHP.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>ALSO CHECK: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/codeigniter-vs-cakephp-vs-yii-vs-laravel\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=phpwordpress-17331-s11&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CODEIGNITER VS CAKEPHP VS YII VS LARAVEL : WHICH FRAMEWORK WOULD YOU CHOOSE IN 2021?<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_SEO_Friendly\"><\/span>5) SEO Friendly<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/seo-friendly.png.webp\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Google<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Question: Which is more SEO friendly between WordPress and PHP?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SEO(Search engine optimization) plays an important role when you develop a website as it directly influences your site\u2019s rank in the search result of Google.
