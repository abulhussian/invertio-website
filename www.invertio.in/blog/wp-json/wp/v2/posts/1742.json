So, it facilitates code organization and reusability, separate logic, and display in a single application. The MVC support provided by Laravel helps to improve application performance and reduces bugs in an app\u2019s code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In addition, it uses an object-oriented approach that ensures better code reusability when building complex apps. If you\u2019re looking for a web development project or startup ideas, then it\u2019s good to consider an MVC framework because these applications are scalable to grow with future requirements of business or technology over time.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let\u2019s Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Get free consultation and let us know your project idea to turn it into an amazing digital product.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Web_blog&amp;utm_medium=Ved&amp;utm_id=Contactus\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Talk To Our Experts<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Built-In_Authentication_and_Authorization\"><\/span>Built-In Authentication and Authorization<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Building and managing user accounts for your web app or service can be a headache, but with Laravel\u2019s built-in authentication, it becomes no more difficult than setting up a simple database table. You can also define permissions on what parts of your website different users are allowed to access based on their roles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This way, you don\u2019t have to give every user admin access to every page on your site and all its features\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead, you can set up specific permissions for certain roles (like admin and editor) and ensure only those who need them have it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Of course, if you want to build more complex security schemes, that option is still there\u200a\u2014\u200ajust make sure it works seamlessly with your authentication system.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Packaging_System\"><\/span>Packaging System<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Laravel\u2019s packaging system is what separates it from a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/popular-php-frameworks-to-watch-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>PHP frameworks<\/strong><\/a>. Not only does it help users install apps with one simple line of code, but it also removes so much hassle in doing so.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You don\u2019t have to worry about configuring composer, figuring out if you have any dependencies and which ones are conflicting with each other\u200a\u2014\u200asimply type composer requires a name. After this, you can install the app for yourself.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Plus, once installed, your app can act as a dependency for another package, meaning even more modularity (and less work!) when working on large projects where many different people are contributing code.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Eloquent_ORM\"><\/span>Eloquent ORM<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Eloquent is a Model-based ORM layer on top of eloquent. It provides modern ActiveRecord pattern implementation. Eloquent makes it easy to query and reason about your database without dealing with SQL. It supports several database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MSSQL (with PDO).<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Eloquent helps abstract away many of the tedious parts of interacting with databases by providing classes for various types of relationships: hasOne, hasMany, belongsToMany. A single eloquent model can be linked to any number of tables in your database.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Multiple_File_System\"><\/span>Multiple File\u00a0System<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Instead of flat files for database tables, Laravel uses a relational database like MySQL. It also stores your database in a separate file called db.php with table names as class property names and fields as class properties.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This system is used by WordPress, Drupal, and Magento and is considered to be better than flat-file databases like those used by Joomla! or MODx. The big advantages of relational databases are flexibility (add\/delete tables or fields), abstraction (you don\u2019t need to know how things work), and security (firewall exploits are harder).<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Overall it can make development faster since you don\u2019t have to write or update things every time you change something in your site structure.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"An Exhaustive Guide of Popular PHP Framework: Laravel\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hMaCH1uYISw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Events_and_Broadcasting\"><\/span>Events and Broadcasting<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Events allow you to easily notify observers (through a listener) that something has happened, such as a new user registering on your site. You can even broadcast events to a number of listeners at once. This is perfect for any sort of update that needs to be communicated to various interested parties.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">An example would be a shopping cart notification: if someone adds an item to their cart, there are many interested parties in that event, namely, the user and potentially administrators who need to know about it so they can ship goods or markdown stock, etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It also helps when you need some sort of asynchronous task done\u200a\u2014\u200alike sending out emails\u200a\u2014\u200aand knowing when all those tasks have been completed. With events and broadcasting, everything will happen in one central location.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Testing\"><\/span>Testing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Using Laravel \u2019s built-in testing tools, it\u2019s easy to write tests for your code. Writing tests can help with everything from catching bugs to providing documentation and even helping other developers understand how your code works.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The PHPUnit testing framework is included with Laravel, so you don\u2019t need to install any additional packages or frameworks. However, if you want to write integration tests (which are more robust than unit tests), you\u2019ll need to install a tool like Selenium.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Task_Scheduling\"><\/span>Task Scheduling<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Just as its name implies, Task Scheduling allows developers to program functions to execute them at a particular time. So if your site is intended for an industry where tasks are scheduled (for example, accounting), then Task Scheduling is worth considering.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Furthermore, utilizing Cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) allows you to access task lists from anywhere and allows multiple users to collaborate on a single project.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Artisan_Console\"><\/span>Artisan Console<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Just look at that list of options! The Artisan console is your one-stop-shop for a variety of commands. From generating new code to running system checks to even generating new routes, you have everything you need in a clean and simple format.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Just check out some of these other artisan commands: Code scaffolding: PHP class stubs based on inputted models can be generated using artisan make: model or entire controllers can be generated using artisan controller:make.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You also get database seeding functionality with artisan db:seed or reverse-engineering function contracts with artisan idea:laravel-ide-helper command.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Templating_Engine\"><\/span>Templating Engine<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Developers and designers have worked hard to come up with great ways to separate logic from presentation. Rather than dumping HTML into PHP templates, developers can break pages down into reusable chunks of code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Designers can concentrate on implementing good design without worrying about how it fits with programmatic components. Since 2011, Taylor Otwell has worked hard to implement some of these concepts in Laravel\u2019s templating engine.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The result is a clean, powerful tool that makes it easy for developers and designers to work together while staying out of each other\u2019s way.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/hire-developers\/hire-php-developers?utm_source=hire_php&amp;utm_medium=Laravel_guide&amp;utm_campaign=Web_blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_1742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Hire PHP developers<\/strong><\/a> from an excellent PHP web application development company; doing so, you will be able to make efficient use of it and will be able to form excellent web applications.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let\u2019s Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Get free consultation and let us know your project idea to turn it into an amazing digital product.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Web_blog&amp;utm_medium=Ved&amp;utm_id=Contactus\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Talk To Our Experts<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h3\"><strong><em>Also read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/top-and-best-companies\/top-php-web-development-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top PHP Web App Development Companies<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Are_The_Benefits_Of_Using_Laravel\"><\/span>What Are The Benefits Of Using\u00a0Laravel?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43303 size-full\" title=\"data 15\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/data-15-.webp\" alt=\"Benefits Of Using\u00a0Laravel\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/data-15-.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/data-15--300x150.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/data-15--768x384.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/data-15--480x240.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Image Source: eTatvasoft<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Some of the advantages of utilizing Laravel include:<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"High-Level_Security\"><\/span>High-Level Security<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Security is an important factor when creating a web application. One of Laravel\u2019s many strengths lies in its powerful authentication support. It allows you to easily manage access to parts of our app. With very little code, you can build authentication for your entire app or just specific sections.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you need multiple roles, it\u2019s easy too. By default, Laravel uses bcrypt to hash your users\u2019 passwords with salting and multi-round hashing, which makes brute force attacks almost impossible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Additionally, 2FA (two-factor authentication) deploys by adding a TOTP secret to your user model via Eloquent\u2019s hasOne() relationship method and then checking for that in your Gatekeeper class if\/else statements instead of standard passwords.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Better_Website_Performance\"><\/span>Better Website Performance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The tools built into Laravel allow developers to build more performant websites. These tools include a dynamic cache that not only stores data but allows you to delete items you no longer need, saving memory on your servers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Your webpages will also load more quickly when they\u2019re built with Laravel because it\u2019s optimized for speed. Since version 5, many of these features have been rolled into their framework counterparts, making it easier than ever to get started building faster and leaner websites with PHP.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This can be critical for low-end and shared hosting environments where Apache is constantly swapping out your website files.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/app-development\/from-idea-to-launch-the-ultimate-guide-to-app-development\/\">From Idea to Launch: The Ultimate Guide to App Development<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Really_Flexible\"><\/span>Really Flexible<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>One of our favorite features about Laravel is how flexible it is. If you code in PHP, then you\u2019ll quickly feel at home with its structure. However, if you\u2019re not a big PHP developer, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t learn it. It uses Blade templating for HTML\/CSS and is relatively easy to pick up.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, if your app grows out of what can be handled by Laravel core, then one of its best features is that it provides a way to add custom packages (called components) to help extend your application and make use of other frameworks like React or Vue.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Simple_Website_Maintenance\"><\/span>Simple Website Maintenance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With a framework like Laravel, you won\u2019t have to worry about all those technical details. Your content team will be able to focus on creating and updating pages while your IT department keeps everything running smoothly on the back end.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With Laravel Framework, your website will always be up-to-date with no downtime and minimal maintenance required by you or your staff. Most changes can be done through simple commands in your terminal window\u200a\u2014\u200aperfect for non-technical users!<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Not only that but data can easily be imported into or exported from a database to suit any business need. All these features come together to offer you an efficient workflow without a lot of headaches.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Great_For_Traffic_Handling\"><\/span>Great For Traffic\u00a0Handling<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Laravel is great for handling large amounts of traffic. It is written in PHP, which has a reputation for being slower than other languages. However, when it comes to serving web pages, PHP is actually very fast.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This means that you can scale your website as much as you want without worrying about performance issues. The framework also makes it easy to add and remove servers without changing any code on your website.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So if you have a lot of traffic and need to scale quickly, then Laravel is a good choice for your project.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cons_of_Using_Laravel\"><\/span>Cons of Using Laravel<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There are a few cons to using Laravel Framework. The first is that it can be more expensive than some of the other options out there. This is because it offers more features and support than many of the other frameworks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Additionally, its popularity means that there can be a shortage of developers who are familiar with it. However, this is quickly changing as more people are learning this framework.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">But despite these few drawbacks, Laravel is still one of the most popular frameworks out there for a reason. It offers an efficient and flexible development process that makes it easy to create high-quality websites. And with its growing popularity, it\u2019s only going to get better in the years to come.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let\u2019s Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Get free consultation and let us know your project idea to turn it into an amazing digital product.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Web_blog&amp;utm_medium=Ved&amp;utm_id=Contactus\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Talk To Our Experts<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Laravel is a powerful PHP framework with growing popularity for a good reason.
