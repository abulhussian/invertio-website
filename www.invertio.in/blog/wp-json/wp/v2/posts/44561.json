The following are the key challenges faced by enterprises:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Talent Shortage<\/h3>\n<p>The number of experienced AI professionals available globally is scarce. With a small percentage of professionals working on AI, the talent pool is too small to fill the demand.<\/p>\n<p>Enterprises usually battle for the same small pool of specialists, making recruitment even more challenging.<\/p>\n<h3>2. High Costs<\/h3>\n<p>Hiring top AI engineers comes with a hefty price tag. Average compensation for positions such as data scientists or machine learning engineers may easily cross approx. $120,000 annual level in most countries, not accounting for benefits. But, for small- and mid-size companies, that is usually unsustainable.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Time-Consuming Process<\/h3>\n<p>Finding, screening, and onboarding skilled AI talent can take months. The prolonged hiring cycle delays AI initiatives and puts companies behind competitors who are already implementing AI.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Skill Mismatch<\/h3>\n<p>AI is a specialized field requiring both technical expertise in crafting enterprise AI staffing solutions and domain knowledge. Many candidates lack the exact combination of skills businesses need.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a candidate may excel at programming but lack experience in deploying AI models for specific industries.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/software-engineering\/guide-to-safeguarding-your-intellectual-property-when-outsourcing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guide to Protect Your Intellectual Property When Outsourcing<\/a><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Top_Reasons_Why_Enterprises_Switching_to_IT_Outsourcing_for_Hiring_AI_Talent\"><\/span>Top Reasons Why Enterprises Switching to IT Outsourcing for Hiring AI Talent<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-44562 aligncenter\" title=\"Why Enterprises Are Investing in IT Outsourcing for Hiring AI Talent\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Why-Enterprises-Are-Investing-in-IT-Outsourcing-for-Hiring-AI-Talent.webp\" alt=\"Why Enterprises Are Investing in IT Outsourcing for Hiring AI Talent\" width=\"800\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Why-Enterprises-Are-Investing-in-IT-Outsourcing-for-Hiring-AI-Talent.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Why-Enterprises-Are-Investing-in-IT-Outsourcing-for-Hiring-AI-Talent-300x216.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Why-Enterprises-Are-Investing-in-IT-Outsourcing-for-Hiring-AI-Talent-768x552.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Why-Enterprises-Are-Investing-in-IT-Outsourcing-for-Hiring-AI-Talent-480x345.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>IT outsourcing has been a feasible alternative for businesses struggling to acquire AI experts.
