But owing to the recent growth of AI, the way software programmers program codes have changed recently. Thanks to the revolution of AI and machine learning in software development for problem-solving, using AI software tools has changed the mindset of the programmer.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/a-realm-of-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence-to-next-gen-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evolution of AI<\/a> has changed the software development circuit for real. Artificial Intelligence has facilitated the processing of large amounts of data and it is an application of individual technologies operating in tandem allowing the computer to perform actions generally reserved by humans.<\/p>\n<p>AI Software Intelligence has been helping the software development arena in various verticals:<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_AI_is_used_in_Software_Development\"><\/span>How AI is used in Software Development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>AI can be used in Software Development for a multitude of purposes:<\/p>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/157657242286323405.png.webp\" alt=\"AI in software development process\" width=\"768\" height=\"332\" \/><\/h2>\n<h3>1. Automated Debugging<\/h3>\n<p>AI software and tools can be used in automated debugging through pattern detection for an in-depth analysis, identification, and categorizing of error types. The deep learning algorithm can easily flag-off errors and speeds up the debugging procedure.<\/p>\n<p>It can even go toe-to-toe with software developers and even learn how to fix each type of bug. Post-training, the machine will be able to automatically spot and correct a huge number of mistakes. Think of it as similar to the text auto-correct feature in smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m comparing it to text auto-correct because AI software suffers a similar issue as seen in the former- the same annoying effect of correcting that user might experience especially in the case of no correction requirement.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Smart Assistants<\/h3>\n<p>AI software assistants are gaining popularity day by day since they intelligently fasten the development process. It even helps novices to learn about the development environment more speedily than the trial and error method.<\/p>\n<p>AI software assistant tools can play the role of a trainer and come up with recommendations, offer code examples and prevent simple coding mistakes like closing parenthesis.<\/p>\n<p>A great example of this is Kite, an assistant developed for Python.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Transform Your Workflow with Smart Assistants!<\/div>\n    <p>invertio can help you integrate these innovative solutions for a smoother workflow.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;amp;utm_medium=Ved_12872_a24&amp;amp;utm_campaign=webblogcontact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>3. Automate Code Generation<\/h3>\n<p>Coding from scratch is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To combat the issues of money and time constraints, researchers have built programs that can write code beforehand. But these solutions are not very good with ambiguity.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, AI software programs came into the picture. It will reduce the workload by a significant amount. Once it masters the underlying patterns, more than code completion, an AI-based software could generate a program by putting together some predefined modules just like LEGO pieces.<\/p>\n<p>In the future, AI software has the potential to replace the task of junior software programmer. This could be the baby steps toward a self-programming machine.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Intelligent-Testing<\/h3>\n<p>Throughout the development cycle, testing has been one of the most crucial elements while you build a quality software product. One of the major challenges that software programmers face while testing out software products is creating a thorough list of use-cases as well as situations that could have an impact on the program\u2019s performance. To ensure the stability of software after new changes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/regression-testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regression testing<\/a> plays a crucial role in maintaining quality across versions.<\/p>\n<p>AI software tools can perform this by going through the previous logs and automatically generating a list of test cases for running through the system. It can also predict the outcomes of testing without even performing the actual tests.<\/p>\n<p>It only focuses on the solution, hence saving a huge chunk of time.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Designing Strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Usually, software developers spend a significant amount of time deciding the features and functionality to be added to a software product.<\/p>\n<p>AI software development tools trained on past software development projects and business factors can analyze existing software and can find a solution, fulfilling the requirements for both the clients and software engineers.<br \/>\nIt can produce a hierarchy of the best features for the success of a solution based on user reviews of similar solutions and client marking.<\/p>\n<p>Want to make AI-based software?
