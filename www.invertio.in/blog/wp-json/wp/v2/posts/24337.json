It received widespread popularity after being posted on Usenet in April 1998.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A couple of years later, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans re-written the significant portions of its codebase for stability. As an open-source project, it is maintained today by thousands of developers worldwide. In addition to WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!, and Magento all use PHP as their core language.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Popular_And_Latest_Versions_of_PHP\"><\/span>The Popular And Latest Versions of\u00a0PHP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PHP language runs on most operating systems (including Windows, Mac OS X, Unix, and Linux) and can be accessed through more than 20 different servers, including Apache, Microsoft IIS, and OracleiAS.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PHP has been around since 1994, and it\u2019s had lots of versions over the years. Here view the list of the most used and latest versions of PHP.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">PHP Version\u00a01.0<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In 1995, Rasmus Lerdorf created a simple set of files that could be uploaded to a web server. Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) allowed web developers to add dynamic content without knowing how to program in HTML. The PHP Version 1.0 includes support for basic HTML tags, variables, flow control statements, and database access.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The first public release of PHP came out on June 8th, 1995, with version number 0.71. This first version was not yet trendy because it required you to recompile your source code every time you wanted to test something out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">However, it already included many features such as:<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">GET\/POST variables; file uploads; session support; cookies; password protection; MySQL database support; output buffering; error handling; register_globals option off by default (on by default since 4); track_vars off by default (on by default since 4); magic quotes off by default (on by default since 4).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">PHP Version\u00a02.0<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Rasmus Lerdorf developed it in 1994. The main goal of PHP 2.0 was to turn it into a full-scale scripting language that is both robust and easy to use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One addition was support for object-oriented programming features such as inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic typing via optional static typing support.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It also allowed developers to create standalone HTML applications; some web servers that are written in PHP have provided these features themselves, so web developers can build fully dynamic websites using nothing but HTML and PHP code without requiring a separate templating engine as they would need with ASP or JSP.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">PHP Version\u00a03.0<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PHP 3 was released on June 22, 2000. It was to be called PHP\/FI (where FI stood for Framework Integration) but was renamed due to a trademark issue with a large German software company that resulted in Zend being able to continue using the name PHP.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This version included many improvements and new features such as user-defined classes, register_globals, type hints, and default arguments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It has been argued that web hosting companies were reluctant to upgrade due to incompatibilities with Apache 1.3 (which accounted for over 65% of web servers at that time). Around late 2001 or early 2002, between 50 and 60% of servers running version 2.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">PHP Version\u00a04.0<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The first major update to PHP, version 4.0, was released in 2001 with a complete rewrite of PHP. It included new features like an HTML parser, automatic memory management, and support for object-oriented programming (OOP).<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The 4.0 release also saw significant improvements to performance and scalability that allowed for larger websites and applications.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In 2008, version 4.1 brought some major changes to both coding syntaxes as well as adding support for Unicode character strings, streamlining shared memory usage in multi-threaded servers, and adding support for regular expressions in string manipulation functions.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">PHP Version 5.0 and\u00a06.0<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In 2002, a new version of PHP was released: version 5. This came after several years without an update, and development had stalled due to disagreements within its community.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The new version, however, set forth a roadmap for future development, which included broad support for object-oriented programming and advanced database integration with SQLite and MySQL. It also brought about many improvements in performance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The significant changes mainly were under-the-hood; some syntactical constructs from previous versions were removed or deprecated in favor of newer constructs that would be more efficient or flexible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PHP 6.0 was released in 2004, with a new object model and support for Unicode and several SQL databases, including Oracle, PostgreSQL, and DB2. This version was intended to be compatible with C++ but fell short due to several compatibility issues that were not resolved until later versions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It was also criticized for being too complex and having many inconsistencies in its implementation; its developers thus deprecated it within a year of its release.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Latest PHP Version\u00a07.0<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/details\/pl-php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/details\/pl-php\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">PHP Version 7<\/em><\/a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> is utilized by 71.5% of all websites.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Released in December of 2015, version 7.0 was delayed as core developers worked to fix major security flaws before officially launching it. The latest iteration includes performance improvements, such as better garbage collection and overall code cleanup, including more consistent and uniform syntax.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">PHP 7 can run twice as fast as PHP 5. Beyond performance boosts, version 7 also includes three new built-in data types:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Fixed-size array.<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">The ability to declare variables without explicitly assigning values.<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Tuples (an ordered container).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Other additions include support for Unicode 8.0 and Internationalization APIs (Unicode Normalization and Namespace Separation). Additionally, version 7 has new syntax for anonymous classes, improved support for generators and coroutines, and a new Opcache component that replaces APC.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In addition to improvements for developers, version 7 also includes several changes geared toward making it easier to deploy secure applications.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, there is built-in support for X.509 certificates, and OpenSSL engine 1.0.2d has been included as part of the core distribution (previously, it was a PECL extension).<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The language itself is more secure as well, with updated escaping rules and better error handling. This new version is already available on most Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, Ubuntu 15.10, and Debian 8 Jessie.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=phpguide_24337_NKY&amp;utm_campaign=webblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17371 aligncenter\" title=\"php developers\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg.webp\" alt=\"php developers\" width=\"810\" height=\"152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg.webp 810w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg-300x56.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg-768x144.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg-480x90.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43582 aligncenter\" title=\"What Are The Main Features And Functionalities Of PHP?\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP-1.webp\" alt=\"What Are The Main Features And Functionalities Of PHP?\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP-1.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP-1-300x225.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP-1-768x576.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP-1-480x360.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Here are the key features of PHP that help make it one of the universal languages around\u2026<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Cross-platform compatibility<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of PHP\u2019s main selling points is its cross-platform compatibility. You can use a single code set to produce web applications, whether for desktop PCs running Microsoft Windows or Apple Macs, tablets running Microsoft Windows and Android, or phones powered by Apple iOS and Google Android.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And, because there\u2019s an abundance of free, open-source tools available for all these platforms, you don\u2019t have to spend money on software development environments that you may only need once in a while. You can also access any existing code libraries as well as install new ones directly through your browser.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Loosely typed\u00a0language<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Also referred to as weak typing, a loosely typed language is one in which variables can be used without declaring their type. These languages also allow some data types to be converted into other types as necessary.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Loosely typed languages often use explicit casting methods if you wish to explicitly change a variable\u2019s type. In PHP, int and float can be cast into string objects with functions like intval() and doubleval().<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Type conversion is automatically applied by loose typing when needed. Still, casting provides an easy solution in those cases where it isn\u2019t. Making use of loosely typed languages doesn\u2019t require you to spend much time on data type declarations or conversions that aren\u2019t strictly necessary\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can just get right down to creating your application.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Error reporting and exceptions<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You can tell your program to throw an exception, which sends it into panic mode and interrupts its flow. When that happens, the execution of your program will stop, and you\u2019ll be notified about what went wrong.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Errors during runtime aren\u2019t easily predicted or solved ahead of time because they arise in response to changing conditions. (You could think of them as bugs.).<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This flexibility is one reason why error handling with exceptions is such a great tool: it works well with a dynamic language like PHP. It allows you to respond quickly to unpredictable events.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Throw in some advanced debugging techniques, like SQL queries and profiling, and you can start identifying problems before they cause too much trouble.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Real-time access monitoring<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This is a feature that allows web hosts to watch for multiple users trying to access a server at once and thus be able to control how many users can use that particular server at one time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Although in most cases, most hosting providers won\u2019t let you run into problems, there are some limits on what can be accessed on your server depending on how many other people are also using it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, if too many people try to access Facebook or some other popular site at once, they may experience slow response times and\/or difficulty accessing it together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Another issue that can come up with being unable to access your website is not being able to receive mail if you have a web-based email service like Gmail or Yahoo Mail.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Object-oriented features<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Another advantage that PHP has over other web programming languages is its object-oriented programming (OOP) support. OOP allows you to create more dynamic and modular applications and makes it easier to create reusable code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of PHP\u2019s key strengths is its robust set of libraries, which allow programmers to reuse existing code instead of rewriting everything from scratch. In a language like Java, where there is no native support for OOP, most web PHP development work is done using frameworks built with JavaScript.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Memory and CPU usage information<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you\u2019re looking to learn more about optimizing your coding, there are a few tools that can be invaluable. First and foremost, there\u2019s xdebug_memory_usage(). This gives you a good idea of how much memory your script uses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you want to get an even better idea about memory usage in real-time, xdebug has an extension called magic_quotes that puts a dot on top of any strings that were escaped by magic quotes (an old function for those who used PHP4).<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The fun part about it is watching strings being passed around and escaping as they go. You will notice memory start to grow as objects\/arrays\/etc. are instantiated, but then you\u2019ll see it shrink again once they are destroyed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">As far as CPU goes, xdebug also has an extension called profiler, which lets you view detailed information about every single line of code that was executed during a page load.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It\u2019s not quite as exciting as memory profiling, but it does give you a perfect idea about where time is being spent when running through different parts of your codebase.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Magic Constants<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In PHP, there is a set of magic constants. A constant is basically a predefined value for something which cannot be changed. They act as operators for comparison and other situations where you want to use a constant rather than using hard-coded values in your program code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The magic constants are created and automatically added when you do various things like creating arrays or objects, etc. There are four different types of magic constants: boolean, integer, float, and string.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">These can be used directly in conditional statements such as if statements, else statements, while loops, and so on. You can also resemble them with each other (for example, with ==) to see if they have equal values or not.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Regular Expression<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A regular expression (abbreviated regex or regexp), also known as a rational expression, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Typically, such practices describe strings of text of interest, possibly with some user-defined repetition and flexibility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The abbreviation regex can be pronounced either to rhyme with the express or rhyme with a check. The difference between these pronunciations is emphasized by Larry Wall in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In contrast to other typical programming languages, in Perl, regular expressions are primarily used for pattern matching and string manipulation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Perl 5 added several built-in functions for working with regular expressions. REs have also been implemented in numerous third-party add-on modules available for many programming languages.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">PDO Class<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The PostgreSQL Data Object (PDO) extension is an interface between PHP and PostgreSQL. For each database connection, there is a corresponding PDO object that implements the four core methods defined by that interface: prepare(), execute(), fetchAll() and close().<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This separation makes it easy to open multiple connections simultaneously without running into problems with name collisions. And, if you\u2019re using namespaces, that simplifies things even further.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Though not required for correct code under PSR-0, it\u2019s a recommended best practice to define classes that contain these PDOs in their namespaces and use autoloading so your application can quickly load them.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Additional Features<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The list of features is never-ending. PHP includes handling images using the GD library, making remote connections with cURL, managing the file system, using sessions to track login details, using SimpleXML Class to read and write XML files, and making the best use of cookies and sessions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Additionally, it supports the shell commands in command-line execution, has the ability to compress zip archives, and is capable of taking full advantage of Ajax.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The features &amp; functionalities of PHP can be used appropriately, but for that, you may require to connect with the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/php-development-services-company?utm_source=php_comp&amp;utm_medium=php_guide&amp;utm_campaign=WebBlog&amp;utm_id=NKY_24337\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">PHP app development company<\/strong><\/a> to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">hire dedicated PHP developers<\/strong>.

New languages are popping up every day, and each one of them seems more impressive than the last!<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">However, if you\u2019re looking to build web applications or sites, there isn\u2019t any competition\u200a\u2014\u200aPHP is the hands-down best language for this type of work. Here are just a few reasons why PHP is the best programming language for web development.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">High-Level Security<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Another big reason people love PHP is that it\u2019s a secure platform. Unlike other platforms, you don\u2019t have to run any code from memory to use it\u200a\u2014\u200aall code runs from disk.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And thanks to its high level of integration with Apache and MySQL, there are fewer security risks. Using three layers of protection (PHP itself, Apache, and MySQL), you\u2019re unlikely to encounter any problems with hackers or viruses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And even if you do, those three layers mean your site will be protected until you can get things sorted out. It\u2019s simple to see why so many developers have chosen PHP over other options when building their next application!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Fast Load\u00a0Time<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of the reasons PHP has been so popular in recent years, especially with web developers, is its speed. Not only does it execute quickly, but it loads sites quickly too.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Combining those two things makes your site\u2019s overall performance much better than that of its competitors. You can almost always increase a page\u2019s conversion rate by using a scripting language like PHP instead of one like ASP or JSP.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And since visitors are most likely to abandon a page if it takes too long to load, using a language that reduces load time can increase profits from increased engagement.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=phpguide_24337_NKY&amp;utm_campaign=webblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17371 aligncenter\" title=\"php developers\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg.webp\" alt=\"php developers\" width=\"810\" height=\"152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg.webp 810w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg-300x56.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg-768x144.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/php-developers.jpg-480x90.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Less Expensive Software<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">When you run a website, you need to be sure that your cost of operation is going to be reasonable. As a simple, lightweight scripting language, PHP requires far less memory than more complex languages like C++ and Java, which means that you\u2019ll need fewer hardware resources.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This can translate into lower software and hardware costs (if you\u2019re outsourcing), making it easier to start an online business. As a result, websites built in PHP tend to have much shorter learning curves, reducing training costs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If your budget is tight when starting up, consider choosing a language like PHP\u200a\u2014\u200ait will certainly help keep your costs down during those first crucial months!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Ease of\u00a0Use<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">While PHP may not be as powerful as some of its more advanced competitors, it\u2019s nevertheless extremely accessible. To work with it, you don\u2019t need to have formal programming training\u200a\u2014\u200aif you can read and follow directions, you should be able to get started in no time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And that\u2019s what makes it such a popular option among new developers: You don\u2019t need special skills or software to begin working with it; all you need is a text editor and access to a server.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Even if you\u2019ve never developed anything before, getting up and running with PHP takes very little time &amp; effort on your part; in contrast, learning other languages like Ruby or Java would mean beginning from scratch.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Simplicity<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Using PHP, you can create a dynamic website in minutes. You need to open up your favorite text editor and start typing code. There are no complex steps involved, no compiling required, and no special tools needed (though there are many useful add-ons). As long as your server has PHP installed, you\u2019re good to go!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Database Flexibility<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, if you decide later on that you want to switch from MySQL to PostgreSQL because of a unique project requirement, it\u2019s easy to do so by writing some code. There is a multitude of other database servers that can be plugged into PHP just as easily.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Additionally, using drivers written in native code allows you to access database features not available through standard APIs, such as prepared statements and stored procedures.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Because all database access through native drivers uses one standard API, there\u2019s less confusion about what kind of queries should or shouldn\u2019t be run against which databases and when to use each.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Database-agnostic systems make it easier for developers to switch between different databases, making things more complicated because each system has its quirks and requirements.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>For Better Clarity Read This: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/php-guide-vital-things-you-should-know-about-php\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PHP Guide: Vital Things You Should Know About PHP<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Most_Popular_Popular_PHP_Frameworks\"><\/span>The Most Popular Popular PHP Frameworks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-43579 aligncenter\" title=\"The Most Popular Popular PHP Frameworks\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP3.webp\" alt=\"The Most Popular Popular PHP Frameworks\" width=\"818\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP3.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP3-300x189.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP3-768x485.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/PHP3-480x303.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Source: Medium<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There are hundreds of PHP frameworks available today, many of which you\u2019ve probably never heard of. Here view some of the most popular and widely used PHP frameworks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, sometimes making use of the PHP framework can be difficult to resolve such issues get connected with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/top-and-best-companies\/top-php-web-development-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PHP development company<\/a> in India as by doing you will be able to hire PHP experts.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Laravel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With an emphasis on minimalism and elegance, Laravel is a developer\u2019s best friend. Laravel powers some of today\u2019s most popular websites, including Kickstarter, Slack, Tesla Motors, Vine, and even Google.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you\u2019re ready to invest your energy into a growing open-source platform with a passionate community, look no further than Laravel. The framework requires very little configuration before you can jump right in and start writing code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The documentation is extensive, and free resources like Laracasts provide you with all sorts of tutorials to master each component quickly and efficiently.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Yii2<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">As a more robust framework, Yii2 is designed to create enterprise websites. This means it may be overkill for smaller websites but is ideal for large sites with lots of traffic and complex backends.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Some standout features include easy command line usage, object-oriented design, MVC architecture (for web apps), and complete test support with coverage reports and DB migrations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Though not free or open source at its core, it has an open core version and an even cheaper personal license if you\u2019re on a shoestring budget.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Symfony<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A web app framework allows developers to use established design patterns and standards to build robust applications rapidly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It uses a modular, service-oriented architecture approach, has no global state, and separates code from content to easily share reusable business components among projects.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Symfony 2 is not backward compatible with Symfony 1; its new components must be integrated with existing apps.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">However, it aims to make integrating those components easier than before, which promises to improve developer efficiency while boosting the speed of development\u200a\u2014\u200acrucial factors when creating enterprise-level software products and large e-commerce websites.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And because it\u2019s open-source (as are all of these frameworks), users have access to Symfony\u2019s continuously updated community knowledge base for support.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Zend<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The Zend Framework project is an open-source software framework for developing web applications and services using PHP 5.3+. Zend Framework includes a range of components based on extensive application usage and feedback from its extensive user base.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The framework follows very closely to Symfony but is not a derivative or fork. It is built with portability and interoperability in mind, with interfaces written in both formal object-oriented code as well as common sense PHPish style, making it easy to integrate into any type of project.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">CakePHP<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With a built-in ORM, support for major databases, and a ton of 3rd party plugins, CakePHP is one of the best options around. Although it has some growing pains (believe me!), there are plenty of forums and tutorials to help you through them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">CakePHP is a great option if you\u2019re just looking for some basic authentication and authorization without spending days hacking together your own framework.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, if you need an easy way to develop CRUD apps with a SQL backend, I would recommend using CakePHP. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that CakePHP supports OOP out of the box and allows you to create your own classes in PHP instead of extending core classes as other frameworks do.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In addition, its routing system makes it easy to organize your application\u2019s URL structure. Last but not least, its scaffolding system makes developing CRUD applications even easier by generating all those boring boilerplate files for you!<\/p>\n<p><em>For More Info Read This: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/codeigniter-vs-cakephp-vs-yii-vs-laravel\/?utm_source=cake+php&amp;utm_medium=php_guide&amp;utm_campaign=WebBlog&amp;utm_id=NKY_24337\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Codeigniter Vs CakePHP Vs Yii Vs Laravel: Which Framework Would You Choose?<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">CodeIgniter<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">CodeIgniter offers a quick and easy way to get started for those just learning how to develop web apps. It\u2019s also great for anyone who wants a fast, no-nonsense development environment that is easy to learn.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">CodeIgniter\u2019s model\u2013view\u2013controller (MVC) structure helps you quickly build apps with a relatively small amount of code. You can install it on shared hosting accounts if you\u2019re tight on space.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">EllisLab created the framework in 2006 as an open-source project. Still, EllisLab has since discontinued its work on CodeIgniter and now offers complete commercial support packages through its partner company, ActiveState.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Related Blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/popular-php-frameworks-to-watch-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 16 PHP Frameworks To Watch Out<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Famous_Applications_Built_Using_PHP\"><\/span>Famous Applications Built Using\u00a0PHP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There are many great applications built using PHP, and here are five that you may have heard of before.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Facebook<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43584 aligncenter\" title=\"facebook\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/facebook.webp\" alt=\"facebook\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/facebook.webp 225w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/facebook-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Source: Facebook<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The most popular and well-known social media platform was developed using PHP, even though it is built using a mix of languages.

You should also look at reviews from previous clients to get an idea of the quality of their work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Finally, make sure to ask for a portfolio of their past projects to get an idea of their style and approach to PHP development.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why should I hire PHP Developers from India?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There are many reasons to hire PHP developers from India; some of them are stated below:<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">&#8211; India has the second-largest number of active PHP developers in the world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">&#8211; The cost of hiring a PHP developer from India is significantly lower than hiring one from another country.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">&#8211; Indian developers are known for their high quality of work and attention to detail.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">&#8211; Indian developers have a strong understanding of both the English language and western culture, which makes communication and collaboration easier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What is the difference between Java and PHP?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Java and PHP are two of the most popular programming languages in the world. They are both used for server-side development, but they have some key differences.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Java is a statically typed language, while PHP is a dynamically typed language.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This means that in Java, variables must be declared with a specific data type, while in PHP, variables can be declared without a data type.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Java is also a more complex language than PHP, and it can take longer to learn. However, PHP is easier to use for web development because it has built-in functions for common tasks such as form handling and database access.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PHP has become one of the most widely used server-side scripting languages globally, and it\u2019s easy to see why.
