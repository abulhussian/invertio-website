If you\u2019re not a developer, or don\u2019t have any coding knowledge, then using a static CMS can be very difficult and frustrating. With WordPress, the only thing you need to do is install the content management system onto your website. Once that&#8217;s done, you&#8217;re ready to start adding posts or pages as required.<\/p>\n<p>Static Content Management Systems (CMS) are a popular choice for small businesses because they&#8217;re easy to use and manage. However, there are many disadvantages of using a static CMS.<\/p>\n<p>One disadvantage of using a static CMS is that it can be challenging to update and maintain. For instance, if your website needs to be updated with new features or content, you will need to update the entire CMS codebase. This can be time-consuming and challenging, specifically if you don&#8217;t have any development experience.<\/p>\n<p>Another disadvantage of using a static CMS is that it can be difficult to find the right template for your website. This is because most static CMS platforms rely on pre-made templates that may not be suited for your specific business or website. You&#8217;ll likely need to customise these templates to fit your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, static CMS platforms can be slow and inefficient when it comes to handling large volumes of traffic. They rely on pre-built templates and internal algorithms that can take longer than traditional web hosting solutions to load.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Save Up to 50% on Website Maintenance Costs<\/div>\n    <p>Let invertio handle your WordPress updates and security, ensuring smooth operation.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;amp;utm_medium=Ved_21652_a24&amp;amp;utm_campaign=webblogcontact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Get Estimate<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Current_Market_For_WordPress_Websites\"><\/span>The Current Market For WordPress Websites<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Many freelance developers and agency owners have been turning to open-source software to avoid potential pitfalls. Open source is a piece of computer code made freely available for use or modification. It also relates to a movement in programming that supports the open sharing of code, design, and other resources.<\/p>\n<p>People increasingly use open source platforms like WordPress for their websites and web applications to save time &amp; money instead of spending thousands on custom development or commercial products like Drupal or Joomla.<\/p>\n<p>Both freelancers and business owners benefit from adding WordPress sites to their portfolios since it offers more work opportunities than competing platforms in a fiercely competitive market.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress is currently the internet&#8217;s most popular Content Management System (CMS). This popularity is due to several reasons, including:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong> WordPress is easy to use: Unlike many other CMSs, which require a lot of technical knowledge to use, WordPress is simple to use. Anyone can create a website using it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong> WordPress is affordable.
