Improper IT alignment with Business<\/h3>\n<p>IT is absolutely critical to the successful deployment of RPA. I find there is a significant difference in speed and cost to deliver between clients that have an engaged and supportive IT function and those where IT is less supportive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong>David Wright, Consulting Partner at Deloitte<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is one of the significant RPA organizational challenges most startups and software companies face.

Undefined Responsibilities &amp; Lack of Ownership<\/h3>\n<p>Many organizations don&#8217;t bother to employ a person responsible for different tasks of an RPA project. This ultimately affects the decision-making process and creates confusion for everyone involved in the project.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, once the RPA solution is implemented, it is the sole duty of a person to understand his\/her role in the new environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to Fix it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is better to clearly define who will be responsible for different aspects of the RPA project. This involves roles for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Design approval<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Execution monitoring<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Success rate measurement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3.

Having an Unclear RPA Strategy<\/h3>\n<p>You must define a strong strategy to avoid automation challenges in business. Zeeshan Rajan, senior IT manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.dk\/da\/services\/2018\/RPA-rapport-engelsk.pdf\">PWC<\/a> said, &#8220;RPA is user-friendly, but everything takes time, and so does an RPA implementation.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;A good basis has to be established to enable further scaling, and that requires a strong foundation with a clear strategy, communication plans, and change management, trained RPA experts, and a stable IT infrastructure\u2014just to name a few examples.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You need to define a strategy that will lead the project. While you do this, you could ask yourself these questions before implementing RPA:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Is RPA a permanent solution or a temporary one?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">What is our aspiration for scaling?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">What are our goals for implementing RPA? How can we measure outcomes?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">When is other technology appropriate, and when will RPA be appropriate?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Segment_2_RPA_Failures_Due_to_Process_Selection\"><\/span>Segment 2: RPA Failures Due to Process Selection<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-44275 aligncenter\" title=\"RPA failures due to process selection\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-2_-RPA-failures-due-to-process-selection.webp\" alt=\"RPA failures due to process selection\" width=\"901\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-2_-RPA-failures-due-to-process-selection.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-2_-RPA-failures-due-to-process-selection-300x140.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-2_-RPA-failures-due-to-process-selection-1024x479.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-2_-RPA-failures-due-to-process-selection-768x359.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-2_-RPA-failures-due-to-process-selection-480x224.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Unable to Optimize and Streamline the Process<\/h3>\n<p>If you try to automate unoptimized processes, it will only result in no output. Hence, you can use this when you want to perform a specific task, even if it is the most optimal solution.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s understand this with an example of a real-life process in which an employee receives an email with some text and some numbers.<\/p>\n<p>These numbers are essential. Instead of retrieving the numbers only from the email, the employee needed to print this email, bind the printed file in a folder, scan it again, and add it to the system as a digital image.<\/p>\n<p>After this, others will find these numbers in the scanned image instead of the original email. The printing and scanning steps need to be removed to automate this process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix this?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For streamlining processes with RPA services, you must do the following things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Optimize and simplify the process by removing unnecessary steps<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Minimize the number of exceptions, if possible<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Take help from RPA developers, business analysts, subject matter experts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>6. Selection of the Wrong Process<\/h3>\n<p>You must know that not all processes are suitable for automation. It is not necessary that automating large processes will bring improvements. Sometimes, it is a small process that could result in significant savings.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, consider these things while hiring RPA candidates. The right people will surely bring you success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Look for template-driven processes that are guided by standardized rules and require manual inputs<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Find out whether the candidate process is standardized to the organization<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Prioritize processes that are used frequently, on a weekly or even daily basis<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Avoid processes that require high-level cognitive tasks<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Check for fault-tolerant processes rather than error-sensitive tasks<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Opt for processes with high business impact<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Segment_3_Implementation_Challenges_of_RPA_Technology\"><\/span>Segment 3: Implementation Challenges of RPA Technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-44276 aligncenter\" title=\"Implementation challenges of RPA technology\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-3_-Implementation-challenges-of-RPA-technology.webp\" alt=\"Implementation challenges of RPA technology\" width=\"902\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-3_-Implementation-challenges-of-RPA-technology.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-3_-Implementation-challenges-of-RPA-technology-300x146.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-3_-Implementation-challenges-of-RPA-technology-1024x497.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-3_-Implementation-challenges-of-RPA-technology-768x373.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Segment-3_-Implementation-challenges-of-RPA-technology-480x233.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>7.
