Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I\/O model that makes it lightweight, efficient, and flawless for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.<\/p>\n<p>Initially released in 2009, it has grown to become one of the most popular languages used in web development today. While written entirely in JavaScript (JS) and running primarily on Linux servers, it has actually been described as one of those technologies you can use to build almost anything: APIs, web applications, and even mobile apps.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>85% use NodeJS primarily for web app development.<\/li>\n<li><strong>LinkedIn, Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Reddit, Tumblr<\/strong>, and <strong>PayPal<\/strong> use <strong>NodeJS<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want to develop a multi-functional application using Node, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/hire-developers\/hire-nodejs-developers\">hire Node developers<\/a> working in one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/software-development-services-company\">best software product development companies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"PHP_Overview\"><\/span>PHP Overview<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43255\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/php.webp\" alt=\"php\" width=\"805\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/php.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/php-300x198.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/php-768x506.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/php-480x316.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>PHP began as a front-end language, but it has evolved over time to include server-side capabilities. Its role continues to expand with each passing year. As of now, PHP has become so advanced that you can use it to develop fully functional sites and applications capable of running on any kind of system.<\/p>\n<p>Companies can choose between different options in order to create a powerful and flexible system with useful features. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that PHP developers are always at an advantage because their experience allows them to build secure websites, web apps, and software for mobile devices like phones and tablets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>45170<\/strong> corporations use <a href=\"https:\/\/stackshare.io\/php\">PHP<\/a> in their tech stacks, including <strong>Facebook<\/strong>, <strong>Delivery Hero,<\/strong> and <strong>Slack<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>PHP is utilized by <strong>77.6<\/strong>% of all websites.

In fact, it\u2019s one of the fastest backend technologies available today.<\/p>\n<p>This speed advantage allows you to develop applications that are more responsive and have a better user experience. Not to mention, it also makes NodeJS ideal for building real-time applications such as chatbots and gaming apps.<\/p>\n<h3>Scalable<\/h3>\n<p>Another big selling point of NodeJS is its scalability. This means that you can easily add new features or functionalities to your application without having to rewrite the entire codebase.<\/p>\n<p>This is because NodeJS uses a non-blocking I\/O model, which makes it very efficient in handling multiple concurrent connections with minimal overhead. As a result, NodeJS can easily scale to support large numbers of users without sacrificing performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Large and active community<\/h3>\n<p>Since NodeJS is an open-source platform, it has a large and active community of developers who are constantly working on improving the technology.<\/p>\n<p>This is critical because it means that you can always find help or support when you need it, and there are always new libraries and frameworks being created for NodeJS.<\/p>\n<h3>Usability<\/h3>\n<p>NodeJS is also very user-friendly, thanks to its JavaScript roots. This means that if you\u2019re already familiar with JavaScript, then you\u2019ll be able to pick up NodeJS relatively easily.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, many front-end developers are now using NodeJS for backend development because of how easy it is to use.<\/p>\n<h3>Reliable<\/h3>\n<p>Another big advantage of using NodeJS is that it\u2019s very reliable. This is because it uses a mode called \u201cevent-driven programming,\u201d which allows the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously without running into any errors.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, you can be confident that your NodeJS application will be able to handle a large number of users without any issues.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Related Blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/outsourcing-and-off-shoring\/top-10-advantages-of-using-nodejs\/?utm_source=Adv_Node&amp;utm_medium=Web_blog&amp;utm_campaign=phpvsnode&amp;utm_id=NKY_2508\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 10 Advantages of Using NodeJS<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Disadvantages_of_using_NodeJS\"><\/span>Disadvantages of using\u00a0NodeJS<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are some disadvantages of using NodeJS, although most of these are minor. Some of the main disadvantages include:<\/p>\n<h3>Not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks<\/h3>\n<p>One of the main disadvantages of NodeJS is that it\u2019s not well suited for CPU-intensive tasks. This is because the JavaScript engine it\u2019s built on is single-threaded, which means that only one task can be processed at a time.<\/p>\n<p>So, if your application needs to perform a lot of computationally intensive tasks, then NodeJS is not the best choice. In these cases, you\u2019re better off with a technology that uses multiple threads or processes, such as PHP.<\/p>\n<h3>Steep learning\u00a0curve<\/h3>\n<p>Another downside of NodeJS is that it has a steep learning curve, particularly for beginners. This is because NodeJS uses a lot of concepts that are not familiar to most developers, such as event loops and callbacks.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, it can take some time to get up to speed with NodeJS. However, once you\u2019ve mastered the basics, you\u2019ll find that NodeJS is actually quite easy to use.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Future-Proof Your Business<\/div>\n    <p>Stay ahead with our forward-thinking PHP and NodeJS solutions.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits_of_using_PHP\"><\/span>Benefits of using\u00a0PHP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>PHP is a tried and tested backend technology that has been around for over two decades. In that time, it\u2019s become one of the most popular backend technologies in the world, powering millions of websites and applications.<\/p>\n<p>If you are also thinking of creating a leading site for your business, then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/hire-developers\/hire-php-developers?utm_source=hire_php&amp;utm_medium=Web_blog&amp;utm_campaign=phpvsnode&amp;utm_id=NKY_2508\">hire PHP developers<\/a>, as they will really help you make your site outstanding and feature-rich.<\/p>\n<h3>Well-established<\/h3>\n<p>One of the main benefits of PHP is that it\u2019s well-established. This means that it has a large community of developers who are constantly working on improving the language.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, you can always find help or support when you need it, and there are always new libraries and frameworks being created for PHP.<\/p>\n<h3>Efficient Performance<\/h3>\n<p>PHP is also very efficient, thanks to its use of an opcode cache. This means that your PHP application will run faster and require less memory than other languages.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, you\u2019ll be able to save money on hosting costs, and your users will enjoy a better experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Easy to\u00a0use<\/h3>\n<p>PHP is also very user-friendly, thanks to its simple syntax. This means that it\u2019s easy to pick up, even for beginners.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, many front-end developers are now using PHP for backend development because of how easy it is to use.<\/p>\n<h3>Reliable<\/h3>\n<p>Another big advantage of using PHP is that it\u2019s very reliable.

Here have compared the few parameters that will help you decide which one is better for your project.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Speed and Performance<\/h3>\n<p>In terms of performance, PHP and Node.js are very similar in performance, based on an event-driven approach to handling requests. However, there are several differences in how they handle concurrency compared to others.<\/p>\n<p>The most obvious difference with respect to concurrency is that while PHP uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space, Node uses a single process with shared memory space and asynchronous communication via message passing.<\/p>\n<p>The upside of using a single process (no fork\/exec) is that it has significantly better performance than PHP for small-scale applications and those applications that need high response times.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, because no child processes are created in case of an error or crash, it means that all application state information would be lost, resulting in data loss.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Development Kit<\/h3>\n<p>The setup process for both PHP and Node.js was quite easy. Both are supported by some of today\u2019s most popular IDEs, such as WebStorm, PhpStorm, Sublime Text 2, and Visual Studio 2013. This makes setting up your environment quite fast and painless.<\/p>\n<p>PHP comes with PEAR, which includes a number of libraries useful for web development (Zend Framework, Symfony2). Likewise, Node comes with npm, which provides over 10K modules that you can use on your project (Express Framework).<\/p>\n<p>Both platforms are very well documented and have extensive communities that love to help you whenever you need it. Overall, both platforms provide a friendly environment to start developing fast and easily.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Environment<\/h3>\n<p>PHP and Node have a few things in common, but also many things that are different. The biggest difference between them is their environment: PHP runs on a server, while Node runs on a client (like your browser). This means that if you\u2019re using PHP, you\u2019ll need to install it on a web server (like Apache or Nginx) before you can run your code.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using Node, however, all you need to do is download an executable file from Node\u2019s website and then run it. If it\u2019s your first time running a program like that, there will be some configuration options that pop up so you can set up your file path.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Drive Success with Us<\/div>\n    <p>Drive your project to success with our unparalleled PHP and NodeJS expertise.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>4. Database<\/h3>\n<p>The biggest advantage of using PHP with MySQL over Node.js and MongoDB is that if you\u2019re coming from a background in PHP, then it will be very easy to get up and running with your data.<\/p>\n<p>The command-line tools are similar to those used in MySQL, so you can get started easily. The software also plays well with Windows environments, which makes PHP a great option if you\u2019re already working on projects that use SQL databases.<\/p>\n<p>While there are some different commands involved when creating a new database or table in MongoDB compared to MySQL, the basic steps of getting your code up and running aren\u2019t too far off what they would be if you were working with MySQL.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Hosting<\/h3>\n<p>As you consider which language to learn first, consider what kind of hosting will be available once you\u2019re ready to create your website. PHP is supported by most shared hosting plans, and there are WordPress plugins that make it easy to add a dynamic component.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt for NodeJS, you may have trouble finding shared hosting that allows it. In fact, VPS or dedicated server space may be required. The latter option can get pricey quickly and might not be within reach if your budget is limited.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to take cost into consideration when deciding on a programming language because starting from scratch\u200a\u2014\u200aboth with development tools and web hosting\u200a\u2014\u200acan add up quickly. To mitigate costs, seeking out an <a href=\"https:\/\/ultahost.com\/dedicated-server-usa\">affordable dedicated server in the US<\/a> could provide a balance between functionality and budget constraints.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"PHP_vs_NodeJS_Comparison_Table\"><\/span>PHP vs NodeJS: Comparison Table<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-24032 size-large aligncenter\" title=\"PHP vs NodeJS Comparison Table\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/PHP-vs-NodeJS-Comparison-Table-993x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PHP vs NodeJS Comparison Table\" width=\"993\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Both Node and PHP are great backend technologies, but they\u2019re quite different.
