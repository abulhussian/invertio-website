A Complete Guide"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>As organizations struggle to keep up with technological innovations and adapt to new practices, it\u2019s not surprising that IT staffing needs are constantly changing. Keeping up-to-date on new technologies and finding professionals with the right skills to work at your company can be daunting.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are many ways in which you can meet your staffing needs while ensuring those workers stay satisfied and engaged in their roles. One of the most effective methods is IT Staff Augmentation.<\/p>\n<p>This e-guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Staff Augmentation Services, from what they are and how they work to choosing the best one for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Before exploring or ready to make a decision, just go through some awesome stats on IT staff augmentation services:<\/p>\n<p>According to a study by Deloitte, the global IT staff augmentation services market is expected to reach $88.9 billion by 2022. The study also found that the North American market for these services is growing at a rate of 5.6% per year.<\/p>\n<p>As per a recent study by Market Research Future, the global IT staff augmentation services market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.8% from 2018 to 2023.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is the largest market for IT staff augmentation services, accounting for more than 35% of the global market in 2019. Other major markets include Western Europe and Asia-Pacific.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"IT_Staff_Augmentation_A_Brief\"><\/span>IT Staff Augmentation: A Brief<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Staff Augmentation supplements an organization&#8217;s existing IT staff with additional personnel. We can do this in many ways, including hiring new employees, contracting with outside firms, or using temporary workers.<\/p>\n<p>Many reasons an organization might choose to augment its IT staff. One common reason is to boost workforce capacity to meet the increased demand for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/?utm_source=invertio&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web%20Blog\">Software Outsourcing Services<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason might be to fill a skills gap within the existing staff. For example, if an organization is implementing a new software system, it may need to supplement its staff with personnel with expertise in that particular software.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, IT staff augmentation can be a helpful way to meet an organization&#8217;s needs. It can provide flexibility and allow an organization to respond quickly to changes in demand. It can also help reduce costs by allowing an organization to use highly skilled workers on a part-time or project basis rather than hiring them full-time.<\/p>\n<p>In staff augmentation, a company hires and takes advantage of employees\u2019 talent from an outside staffing firm that provides services to meet your company\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let's Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Looking to increase productivity and reduce costs? Staff augmentation could be ideal for you!<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=staff- augmentation-guide_28993_GB&amp;utm_campaign=webblog\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Get a free Consultation<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_Of_Staff_Augmentation\"><\/span>Types Of Staff Augmentation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While many IT staff augmentations are available, we can categorize them into three types. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of each category:<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Commodity\"><\/span>Commodity:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>These are staff augmentation tasks that freelance contractors can easily and quickly handle. A quick search for a freelancer will turn up dozens of qualified candidates within minutes. There is no interview process to find the perfect person for the job. If you have one-time projects and need someone on your team to complete them, commodity staff augmentation is perfect.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Non-commodity\"><\/span>Non-commodity:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Non-commodity IT staff augmentation tasks are more in-depth and require skills or knowledge that are hard to find. If you\u2019re looking for a specialized skill set, such as someone who knows how to design websites, you\u2019ll probably have to conduct an extensive search, even if it means hiring someone full-time.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Skill-based\"><\/span>Skill-based:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Skill-based staffing is used when a business needs to fill an open position with a skill set it doesn\u2019t currently have on its payroll. There are often high barriers to entry for these positions because these skills are hard to find, so staffing agencies may require potential employees to take tests or prove their qualifications before being considered.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Highly_Skilled\"><\/span>Highly Skilled:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>High-skilled staff augmentation falls into short-term and long-term categories. Short-term is what it sounds like, workers who come in for short periods (often weeks) while your regular team takes a vacation. Long-term hires typically stay on your payroll full-time, but you cannot handle 100% of their workload. They work as support while your regular team handles the heavier stuff.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read &#8211; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/what-is-staff-augmentation-how-does-it-works-a-complete-guide\/\"><strong>What Is Staff Augmentation &amp; How Does It Works? A Complete Guide<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Different_Types_of_Staff_Augmentation_Models\"><\/span>Different Types of Staff Augmentation Models<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Staff Augmentation models can increase productivity and efficiency while providing access to skilled professionals who can help a company achieve its goals. Companies can improve their bottom line with the right model while successfully managing projects.<\/p>\n<p>Staff Augmentation Models are divided into four main categories: Dedicated Team, Time and Materials, Project-Based Outsourcing, and Managed Services.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Dedicated_Team_Model\"><\/span>The Dedicated Team Model<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It is the most commonly used Staff Augmentation Model. This model involves hiring a team of dedicated professionals to provide specialized skills and expertise to a company. This team is then managed as part of the internal team, with all resources and expertise provided by dedicated professionals.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Time_and_Materials_Model\"><\/span>The Time and Materials Model<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It involves engaging an external service provider hourly to supplement a company\u2019s in-house staff. The service provider typically provides the necessary infrastructure and professional services to accomplish the project.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Project-Based_Outsourcing_model\"><\/span>The Project-Based Outsourcing model<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It involves having a service provider manage and execute the entire scope of a project from start to finish. This typically includes designing, developing, testing, and deploying the project. The service provider manages all aspects of the project life cycle and can provide specialized resources as needed.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Managed_Services\"><\/span>Managed Services<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It is a Staff Augmentation model where the service provider provides managed services such as hosting, maintenance, and support to a company. This arrangement allows companies to focus on their core business activities without worrying about managing and executing IT projects themselves.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which type of Staff Augmentation Model is used, it is important to ensure that the chosen service provider is reliable and provides quality service. It is also essential to have a well-defined agreement in place that outlines the terms and conditions of the partnership, as well as any other key details.<\/p>\n<p>With the right model in place, companies can reap the benefits of staff augmentation without sacrificing quality or efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, one should select a suitable Staff Augmentation model based on the needs of the company and its budget. By selecting a reliable service provider, combined with a well-defined agreement, companies can ensure that they can maximize resources and achieve their goals.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Helpful Resource:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/top-7-it-staff-augmentation-service-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 20 IT Staff Augmentation Service Companies<\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Should_You_Hire_An_External_Support_Team\"><\/span>Why Should You Hire An External Support Team?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Rely on an external support team for your IT needs when you need a more consistent and personalized level of service. When staff augmentation is in place, your company will be more productive because it\u2019s free from responsibilities that take up valuable time and energy.<\/p>\n<p>These Augmentation Services come in many flavors, but their commitment to the customer is their common denominator.<\/p>\n<p>You can hire either onsite or remote employees. Both have advantages and disadvantages, depending on your business needs.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Onsite_Staff_Augmentation\"><\/span>Onsite Staff Augmentation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Onsite staff augmentation means working with IT support professionals in your company\u2019s office space. It gives them a direct line of sight into what\u2019s happening with your network and your technology infrastructure to address the issues quickly and immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Onsite staff augmentation is more expensive, but it gives you direct access to your support professionals. You can also choose when and how you would like their assistance.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Remote_Staff_Augmentation\"><\/span>Remote Staff Augmentation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Remote staff augmentation means they work from another location outside of your office space, usually at home or in a co-working facility.<\/p>\n<p>With remote staff augmentation, software outsourcing services are cheaper overall because there is no cost associated with office space or equipment that a contractor must use. However, these workers often require more oversight because they aren\u2019t sitting in front of your company\u2019s network daily.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"What Is Staff Augmentation &amp; How Does It Works\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2Bwa5_8gwSo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Do_IT_Staff_Augmentation_Services_work\"><\/span>How Do IT Staff Augmentation Services work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are a number of ways that IT staff augmentation services work. Typically, these services provide IT professionals to organizations on a contract basis. This can be done in a number of ways, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing IT professionals to fill specific roles within an organization on a short-term or long-term basis<\/li>\n<li>Providing IT support on an as-needed basis<\/li>\n<li>Offering managed IT services to supplement an organization&#8217;s existing IT staff<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>IT staff augmentation services can be customized to meet an organization&#8217;s specific needs. For example, an organization may need help with a specific project or application. In this case, the staff augmentation provider would supply the necessary personnel to get the job done.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, an organization may need ongoing support for its IT infrastructure.

If your in-house team is already stretched thin and you&#8217;re facing an upcoming project with a tight deadline, augmenting your staff with outside help can be a lifesaver.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason to consider staff augmentation is if you need expertise that isn&#8217;t available in-house. For example, if you&#8217;re planning a major website redesign, you may need to bring in a user experience (UX) expert or someone with specific design skills.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, staff augmentation can be a cost-effective way to maintain a high level of quality control. If you&#8217;re working on a critical project, augmenting your staff with additional quality assurance (QA) resources can help reduce the risk of errors and ensure a successful outcome.<\/p>\n<p>When deciding whether to augment your staff, it&#8217;s important to consider the cost and timeline of the project, as well as the skills and experience of your in-house team. You may contact a reputable IT staffing firm for advice if you&#8217;re unsure whether staff augmentation is right for your project.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-27991 size-full\" title=\"1 2\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"IT Staff Augmentation \" width=\"800\" height=\"2536\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg-95x300.webp 95w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg-768x2435.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg-323x1024.webp 323w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg-485x1536.webp 485w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg-646x2048.webp 646w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/1-2.jpg-146x463.webp 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let's Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Looking to increase productivity and reduce costs?

Additionally, they can be contracted to bring on temporary staff when a significant workload increases.

But what if you need help from outside companies to understand which IT services are best for your company? Consider asking for a free consultation from invertio Consultants.<\/p>\n<p>Determine which IT Staff Augmentation solutions will have minimal impact on your current staffing. Look at projects that don\u2019t need to complete immediately or tasks that can be delayed. Your outsourcing provider should have no trouble helping you identify and prioritize which applications you should handle internally vs. which ones you should outsource.<\/p>\n<p>The distinction is easier when your company only has a few IT personnel, and there aren\u2019t any pressing needs for new software or hardware. For example, outsourcing services make sense if your business doesn\u2019t need video conferencing equipment until your needs change and expand.<\/p>\n<p>Next is to make sure you always have an outside contractor to fall back on. This allows you to keep things under control in your business and take advantage of outsourcing when it makes sense for your company.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you need help installing a new database management system, you can contact an IT Staff Augmentation provider for assistance. Afterward, go back to handling database management internally by leveraging a remote cloud database server from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/cloud-services\/amazon-cloud\">Amazon Web Services<\/a> (AWS).<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to research your options carefully and find an IT staff augmentation provider that you feel confident in. Each outsourcing agreement is unique, but all of them should offer a contract where you have complete control over when your company is on call for support and what happens when that time comes.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>IT Staff Augmentation helps companies reduce operational costs and enhance core competencies.
