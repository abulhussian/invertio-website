The growing popularity of learning platforms like Edmodo and Pear Deck shows that many students (and teachers) love learning from peers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you\u2019re creating an educational app, include a way for users to interact with one another in some capacity\u200a\u2014\u200aideally, a platform that promotes collaborative sharing, feedback, and problem-solving.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Students will take great ownership over their own learning if they feel like they can collaborate with other users when solving problems or asking questions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Think about how you can incorporate social functionality into your educational mobile app development process\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding discussions, commenting systems, and interactions like #hashtags.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, think about how you can make it easy for teachers to access student work and respond accordingly. With so much potential value being created by students, it\u2019s important to give them tools that help them showcase their work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A teacher should be able to easily view all student submissions within an app at once and provide comments back on those submissions via simple thumbs up\/down buttons.
