DevOps, an extension of the agile system, uses automation to keep SDLC flowing at ease. By promoting a culture of interaction &amp; greater collaboration, it provides a measure of rapid and continuous responses so that any issues are fixed over time and the release is done quickly.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>High-level collaboration:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Today, more than ever, development teams need to break the branch-office and engage in active communication, 24 hours a day. DevOps paves the way for business development by providing the necessary spirit of collaboration, communication, and integration between the globally distributed teams in IT. Boundaries are set by activities that are transparent in the DevOps stimulus environment. All team members are responsible for meeting the desired features\/quality and timing of what will be brought together.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Quality customer experience<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With DevOps, organizations can increase their frequency by 200x, turnaround time by 24x, and reduce change to error rates by 3x. By adjusting the transmission line, it becomes possible to have the reliability and stability of the application after each new release. If the application works seamlessly in creation, organizations benefit from greater customer satisfaction.<\/span><br \/>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #000042;\"><b><i><span style=\"color: #000080;\">So, do you want to leverage the benefits of DevOps for your organization?
