Our new app idea can be of great help in all such situations. You can implement this app idea by adding training modules on rare machinery and equipment. One app that has inspired us is<strong> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metaio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metaio\">Metaio\u2019s<\/a><\/strong> which offers an AR-based repair tool and there are countless apps to be developed by the<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/hire-developers\/hire-augmented-reality-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> VR\/AR developers<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0in the industry.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><b>4) Shopping Sites<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p id=\"4df7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you buy a new piece of furniture for your home, it happens that it doesn\u2019t fit your home space or it doesn\u2019t go with the d\u00e9cor of your house. Now, what will you do? Do you replace it to make it work? No, simply go for the IKEA app that let you try out their range of furniture in any room. Yes, it&#8217;s true. And, this is our new app idea where you only need to use your phone camera to see whatever furniture you like virtually. It also allows you to discover the range of furniture in various colors and styles.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><b>5) New App Idea for AR teleconferencing\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p id=\"f45c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the idea of sitting in a boardroom for another status update makes you unhappy, then our AR and VR new app idea is the best fit for you.

Our new app idea will allow you to use anchors and tracking features to scan the construction site on your iPhone. Here are a few examples of how the AR and VR apps can be used for site management:<\/p>\n<p id=\"14a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the electrical lines and plumbing lines on your construction site will appear where they will be placed using only the Apple iPhone or iPad.<\/p>\n<p id=\"6688\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">ARKit tool allows applications to provide a complete analysis of a construction site in real-time by scanning the project site.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><b>7) New App Idea for Interior Designers\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p id=\"7fa4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">With our new app idea of AR\/VR for interior designing, you can style any room in the desired layout before you even buy a single piece of furniture.
