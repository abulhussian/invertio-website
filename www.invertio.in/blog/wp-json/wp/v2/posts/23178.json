Let\u2019s take a glimpse at some of them:<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Similarities_between_Ruby_on_Rails_and_Java\"><\/span>Similarities between Ruby on Rails and Java<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Both are open-source frameworks.<\/p>\n<p>Java is more popular than Ruby on Rails in the enterprise world, but it\u2019s not applicable for low-traffic websites due to its memory requirement of about 150MB. At the same time, Ruby on Rails can work with 16 MB RAM and very less processing power.<\/p>\n<p>Ruby on Rails uses the MVC pattern while Java follows the model view controller pattern.<\/p>\n<p>Both have large community support and IDEs to provide multiple tools for editing, refactoring, debugging, etc.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Dissimilarities_between_Ruby_on_Rails_and_Java\"><\/span>Dissimilarities between Ruby on Rails and Java<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Java is an easy-to-learn language, while Ruby takes time for coding as it has various syntaxes; hence beginners find it difficult with it.<\/p>\n<p>Java runs on the server-side and uses the JVM, but Ruby has a faster execution speed as it compiles into native machine code before running, thus making it easier to debug and deploy with fewer configuration changes for OSs.<\/p>\n<p>Although both have various similarities and dissimilarities, Ruby on Rails is better when it comes to web development as it has a more concise syntax, follows the MVC pattern, and helps in dividing an application into three parts. Also, due to its popularity amongst developers, there are a number of online resources and support communities available for Ruby on Rails.<\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re looking forward to developing web applications, then you should<a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/hire-developers\/hire-ror-developers\"> hire Ruby on Rails developers in India<\/a> as the demand is very high for RoR web app development.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the Java application development process can be easier and hassle-free for your business, and for this, you just need to hire dedicated Java developers working in the top-rated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/java-web-application-development-company?utm_source=Web_blog%2823178%29&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=Java\">Java web application development company.<\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Choosing the Right Path<\/div>\n    <p>Ruby on Rails or Java for Web App Development?<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=23178+-+java-developers-vs-ruby-rails&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ruby_on_Rails_vs_Java_Which_one_to_choose\"><\/span>Ruby on Rails vs Java: Which one to\u00a0choose?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As both Ruby on Rails and Java are used for web application development, it\u2019s often difficult to decide which one is the best. However, when it comes to picking up between these two programming languages, there are certain factors that can help you choose what suits your business needs better than others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let us discuss some of them below:<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Code_Readability\"><\/span>Code Readability<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In Ruby on Rails, there is a practice of using Gems for extending its functionality, whereas, in Java, it\u2019s possible to add libraries and frameworks. Some programmers find the former approach more useful as gems are easier to understand with the documentation provided. However, some others believe that adding new code or libraries might cause conflicts that can be difficult to debug.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, it can be said that code readability is better in Ruby on Rails when compared to Java.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Programming_Paradigms\"><\/span>Programming Paradigms<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ruby on Rails (RoR) follows the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps in dividing an app into 3 parts: model, view, and controller. This makes it more simple to develop and maintain an app as different aspects can be handled by different individuals. Java also supports MVC but doesn\u2019t enforce it.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, Ruby on Rails is more suitable for those who are looking for a programming paradigm that enforces separation of concerns.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Community_and_Support\"><\/span>Community and Support<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>RoR has a large and active community that helps in resolving issues and queries related to the language very quickly. The Java community is also quite big but might not be as supportive as the Ruby community.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, when it comes to support and help in times of need, Ruby on Rails is much better than Java.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Scalability\"><\/span>Scalability<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Scalability is found to be equal for both programming languages because both are based on MVC patterns. However, if you are looking for frameworks that specifically support scalability, then Java can be the edge over Ruby on Rails.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Performance\"><\/span>Performance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Ruby on Rails&#8221; language is often criticized for its poor performance as compared to Java. However, with the release of Ruby on Rails version five, there is no more issue with this language.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, in terms of overall performance, both Java and Ruby on Rails are neck-to-neck.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Popularity\"><\/span>Popularity<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Java is an older programming language but is still very popular. Ruby on Rails, in comparison, might be a little less popular than Java, but it\u2019s gaining traction at a rapid pace. Moreover, there are many websites built on the Ruby on Rails framework as compared to Java, so the popularity of this web development framework is increasing day by day.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, Ruby on Rails is gaining popularity faster than Java and might soon become the most popular programming language.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Productivity\"><\/span>Productivity<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ruby on Rails is a little slower when compared to Java, but it\u2019s much more productive. Developers can build an app quickly with fewer errors as it supports rapid application development.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, there are many factors like productivity support for complex tasks, built-in libraries, and community support that make Ruby on Rails a better choice for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/web-application-development\">web application development<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Security\"><\/span>Security<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Java is more secure than Ruby on Rails as it has a larger community and better resources. Moreover, Java has been designed for enterprise applications and hence is more robust when it comes to security.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, if security is your primary concern, then Java would be the better choice over Ruby on Rails.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"User_Experience\"><\/span>User Experience<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>With the help of Ruby on Rails, it\u2019s possible to build an app with a great user experience. It also supports rapid development so that users get faster results and interaction. Java is not as good in this aspect but can still be made responsive enough for apps or websites.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, there are many features like speed, ease of development, and responsiveness that make Ruby on Rails a better choice for user experience.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Also Read: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/java-vs-javascript-which-is-a-better-choice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Java vs JavaScript: Which Is A Better Choice?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ruby_on_Rails_vs_Java_Comparison_Table\"><\/span>Ruby on Rails vs Java: Comparison Table<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23180\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/RoR-vs-java.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/RoR-vs-java.png.webp 621w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/RoR-vs-java.png-300x186.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/RoR-vs-java.png-480x297.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ruby on Rails is a better programming language than Java when it comes to web application development.
