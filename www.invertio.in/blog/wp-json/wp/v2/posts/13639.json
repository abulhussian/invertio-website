The COVID-19 outbreak is said to have started in December 2019, when a lot of patients were getting admitted to hospitals in China with cases of pneumonia. There was an explosion in Pneumonia cases which initiated suspicions about a possible outbreak of an unknown disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these unprecedented cases of pneumonia were only recognized when a doctor saw the pattern in hospital records. By that time, it was already too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could this outbreak have been recognized earlier than it was? Yes, it definitely could have been. But for that to happen, the hospital would have needed technological assistance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if hospitals in Wuhan city in China had an application that keeps records of all cases, analyses data through machine learning algorithms, and lets its users know if there\u2019s an unusual pattern of cases?. Had there been such machine learning applications in place, the COVID-19 outbreak would have gotten detected much earlier and helped the Chinese government prevent it from spreading as much as it did eventually.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The novel coronavirus has taught us an important lesson.

These are machine learning algorithms that help it imitate human conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, we have mostly seen chatbots used for customer services. They are even used as a virtual assistant if you are using Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, or Google\u2019s Assistant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But is it hard to imagine a personalized chatbot that uses machine learning algorithms and data to help customers make better buying choices? Yes, there are already recommendation engines on platforms such as Amazon that already do a good job in recommending products to buyers. Personalized recommendations drive 35% of Amazon\u2019s overall sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this idea goes beyond product recommendations. You see, a chatbot using ML algorithms can also ask what buyers are looking for. Then, based on the data of other buyers of the platform ML chatbot can help someone compare two different products of similar categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, let\u2019s say that a buyer is looking for a smartphone on an eCommerce website. This website has a machine learning chatbot that asks users what they are looking for. This is different from searching, as the chatbot understands what a buyer needs specifically. Say, this buyer wants a smartphone with 6GB RAM. The chatbot shows the buyer all models with 6GB RAM.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the buyer can\u2019t just choose any random phone. They need to know the differences. This is where he\/she can ask the chatbot about it. The chatbot then goes through reviews and tells the user how two different models of smartphones having similar features are different from each other.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Requirements for a Personalized Chatbot Application<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The features of this chatbot app idea require it to have information about a product (to compare it with another). Data from user comments could be utilized by the chatbot to optimize its algorithm.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an eCommerce website that uses data from buyer comments on products, the comment interface should be designed in such a way that it makes it easier for the algorithm to understand buyer context.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of an NLP engine would be essential for the ML chatbot to communicate with human buyers smoothly and this will help you in building leading machine learning apps.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Crafting Tomorrow's Solutions with ML<\/div>\n    <p>Consult for Personalized Machine Learning Applications<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;amp;utm_medium=Ved_13639_a24&amp;amp;utm_campaign=webblogcontact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Connect With Us<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Personalized Recommendation app &#8211; For physical Retail Stores!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalized recommendation engines are highly proven ways to increase sales for eCommerce and content streaming platforms.
