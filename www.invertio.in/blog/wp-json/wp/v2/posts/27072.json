You don&#8217;t need to buy or maintain a server to store data because it&#8217;s all stored in the cloud. You can access the data from anywhere as long as you have an internet connection, making it easier to work remotely. With cloud computing, you don&#8217;t have to worry about backing up files because it automatically backs up everything and is available whenever you need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud computing services come in two basic categories. The first type is known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), which provides virtualized resources like servers, storage space, and network capacity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other type is Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which provides development tools, programming languages, and operating systems that developers use when creating applications. A common choice among AI Development Company founders looking to get started with AI is PaaS providers like Amazon Web Services that offer AI tools like TensorFlow.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/top-cloud-computing-trends-that-will-shape-businesses-in-the-coming-years\/?utm_source=Organic&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top Cloud Computing Trends That Will Shape Businesses In The Coming Years<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Distinctive_Features_Of_Blockchain_Cloud_Computing\"><\/span><strong>Distinctive Features Of Blockchain &amp; Cloud Computing\u00a0<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud computing and blockchain technology might look the same.

In contrast, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/blockchain-ml\/blockchain-industries\/\">blockchain technology<\/a> only stores data in one location. This means that if there were a virus or natural disaster near your office, all of your important files would not be lost. Here are five real-world cloud service applications:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Dropbox<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With over 300 million users, Dropbox has revolutionized the way we store information on the internet.

It also offers automatic backup as soon as you save a file so that even if your computer crashes, everything will still be saved and accessible.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Google Apps<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Another useful cloud storage application is Google apps. It gives you 15 gigabytes of free storage, which can be upgraded \u200cby paying monthly fees ranging from $1-$10 per month, depending on the size. You can easily organize files into folders and sub-folders by color coding them with Google Drive&#8217;s labeling system, making it easier to find what you&#8217;re looking for.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b> SlideRocket: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SlideRocket is another excellent app for small business presentations.
