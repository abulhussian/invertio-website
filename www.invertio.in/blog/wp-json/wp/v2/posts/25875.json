But a few businesses attempted it and they struck gold. Most of us would never have imagined that developing economies such as India, China, and the Philippines would \u200cbe a gold mine for some of the world&#8217;s most successful countries. It all started as an experiment and then turned into one of the most popular practices in software development.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offshore software development gives access to cheaper yet effective solutions from areas of the world where operating costs are much lower than in the west. This is because labor rates in countries like India and China are much lower than in developed countries. Offshore development also gives companies access to a global talent pool. This is especially beneficial for businesses with limited resources or those that need to quickly ramp up their development capacity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, it&#8217;s not that easy. There are many things involved in making this lucrative and viable operation a success. This whitepaper will discuss these issues and present their solution to you understandably.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Evolution_Of_Offshore_Software_Development\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evolution Of Offshore Software Development<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of offshore software development originated in the early days of computing when companies would contract out work to programmers in India and other countries to take advantage of lower labor costs. However, this practice was not widely adopted until the 1990s, when advances in telecommunications technology made it possible for companies to collaborate with service providers located around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that time, developed countries were a relatively untapped resources for software development, and companies were able to get quality work at a fraction of the cost of hiring programmers in the United States.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, offshore software development is a popular way for companies to cut costs and improve efficiency. By outsourcing work to a low-cost provider, businesses can save money on wages and benefits while still maintaining control over quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offshore software development has continued to grow in popularity as more and more companies realize the potential cost savings. Additionally, many offshore development firms have worked hard to improve their quality and customer service, making them a more attractive option for businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let's Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Transform your business with invertio' reliable and cost-effective offshore software services.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Organic+-+29189-offshore-resource-hiring-guide&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us Today!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reputed global companies such as Intel, American Express, Aetna, U.S. Healthcare, Compaq, General Motors, Home Depot, IBM, Microsoft, Motorola Shell, and 3M have set up their own offshore software development centers or entered \u200cstrategic alliances with off shore software companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Offshore_Resources_Hiring_Models\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offshore Resources Hiring Models<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25878 size-full\" title=\"offshore and onshore\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186033.png.webp\" alt=\"Hiring models of Offshore Resource\" width=\"549\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186033.png.webp 549w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186033.png-300x157.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186033.png-480x252.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offshore outsourcing, often shortened as just outsourcing, is when a company moves its business process to a country that is not geographically located nearby.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Team_Augmentation\"><\/span><strong>Team Augmentation<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary offshore resources hiring model is the team augmentation model. This model involves bringing on contractors for only a specific amount of time and often for just a specific project or tasks that are needed to be done.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To effectively execute the team augmentation hiring strategy, employers should look for individuals with skill sets that are well suited for their needs, but not necessarily any resources who possess in-depth knowledge of the business or industry they\u2019re working within. This ensures they\u2019ll have the flexibility they need when it comes time to move on from their contracting employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OnsiteOffshore\"><\/span><strong>Onsite\/Offshore<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The onsite\/offshore model is a way of organizing work in which some tasks are performed on-site, while others are performed off-site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work is first divided into two categories: tasks that can be performed on-site, and tasks that must be performed off-site. On-site work is typically done by employees of the company itself, while off-site work is subcontracted to another firm.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>This arrangement can offer several advantages\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, it can save money. Employees working on-site usually cost more than those working off-site, so by outsourcing some tasks, companies can reduce their labor costs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, it gives organizations the ability to tap into a global pool of talent. This can be especially beneficial for companies that cannot find the talent they need locally.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, it leads to improved efficiency and productivity by leveraging the best practices of both onshore and offshore.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"imgtrigger\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25898 size-full\" title=\"Whitepaper CTA 1\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-1.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Whitepaper CTA 1\" width=\"1600\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-1.jpg.webp 1600w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-1.jpg-300x69.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-1.jpg-768x177.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-1.jpg-1024x236.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-1.jpg-1536x353.webp 1536w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-1.jpg-480x110.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pure_Offshore\"><\/span><strong>Pure Offshore<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term &#8220;pure offshore model&#8221; refers to a business arrangement in which all aspects of the work are carried out offshore, with no onshore involvement\u200c. In this type of arrangement, a company contracts with another company (or individual) to have certain work tasks performed by the second company (or individual). The key characteristic of an offshore model is that the work is contracted to be performed outside of the contracting party&#8217;s home country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One example of a company that employs a pure offshore model is invertio, an Indian IT services company. invertio offers its services to clients around the world, but all of its operations are based in India. This allows the company to take advantage of lower labor costs in India while still being able to serve clients in developed markets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several advantages that can come from using a pure offshore model. First, it can save businesses a significant amount of money, as they don&#8217;t need to pay for onshore talent or resources. Second, it can help businesses tap into global expertise and perspectives, as they&#8217;re not limited to working with an onshore team. And third, it allows businesses to move faster with faster turnaround times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OffsiteOffshore\"><\/span><strong>Offsite\/Offshore<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The offsite\/offshore model involves having your company\u2019s software written by a team of programmers who work from home or in a remote office location.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has two main benefits over onsite employment models: lower overhead costs (no physical offices or large teams of employees) and speedier development times (some firms report 2-3x faster product time-to-market).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, offsite work comes with its own set of risks, which includes difficulties in communication, language barriers, and sometimes fraud. Because of these risks, some companies choose to hire firms that are regulated by either local government or industry associations. If you decide offshore is right for your business or project needs, we recommend finding an expert advisor before entering \u200cany agreement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_You_Should_Go_For_Offshore_Resources_Hiring\"><\/span>Why You Should Go For Offshore Resources Hiring?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25881 size-full\" title=\"Group 186129\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186129.png.webp\" alt=\"Global data of Offshore Resource\" width=\"538\" height=\"628\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186129.png.webp 538w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186129.png-257x300.webp 257w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186129.png-397x463.webp 397w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should go for offshore resources hiring if you&#8217;re trying to get your business started up quickly and efficiently. The offshore model can be extremely cost-effective since you won&#8217;t have to worry about covering any overhead costs associated with setting up an in-house team. This type of arrangement also helps improve communication and collaboration between your teams, since they&#8217;ll no longer be working in silos.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, if you choose to work with a reputable offshore partner like invertio you can be confident that your project will be in expert hands.

There are multiple reasons that work behind this\u200c.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, the cost of living in developed countries is \u200chigher than in developing countries. This means that developers in developed countries will need to earn higher salaries just to maintain their standard of living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed countries often have stricter laws and regulations around employment, including things like minimum wage laws and employee benefits. This can add significant costs to hiring local developers compared to hiring offshore developers who may not be subject to the same laws and regulations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, developed countries have a more sophisticated and complex economy, so businesses operating in these countries will \u200cneed more expensive developers with more specialized skill sets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25883 size-full\" title=\"Group 186037\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186037.png.webp\" alt=\"Benefits of Offshore Resource\" width=\"497\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186037.png.webp 497w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186037.png-300x264.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186037.png-480x422.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_Dearth_Of_The_Required_Skill_Set\"><\/span><strong>A Dearth Of The Required Skill Set<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lack of the required skillset locally can make businesses look to hire offshore developers. For example, if a business needs a software developer with expertise in a certain programming language that is not widely taught in the United States, they may have to look overseas for a developer who is fluent in that language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One main reason is that the demand for developers with specific skills continues to grow, while the number of domestic candidates possessing these skills remains relatively static. And when you factor in the high cost of salaries and benefits for developers in the U.S., it becomes clear why so many companies are turning to outsourcing as a viable option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many offshore developers are willing to work for less money than their on-shore counterparts, which can save business money in the long run. Outsourcing development work in countries like India or Russia can be up to 50 percent cheaper than hiring domestically.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Unable_To_Scale_And_Expand_Business_Offerings\"><\/span><strong>Unable To Scale And Expand Business Offerings<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses often turn to offshore developer hiring in order to expand their business offerings.

This is because the cost of living and doing business in certain parts of the world is much lower than it is in North America or Europe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offshore developer hiring can help businesses scale their operations by giving them access to a wider pool of talent at a lower cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"imgtrigger\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25899 size-full\" title=\"Whitepaper CTA 3\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Whitepaper CTA 3\" width=\"1600\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg.webp 1600w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg-300x69.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg-768x177.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg-1024x236.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg-1536x353.webp 1536w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg-480x110.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"High_Infrastructure_Cost\"><\/span><strong>High Infrastructure Cost<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offshore developer hiring can help reduce infrastructure costs in a few ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, by outsourcing development work to a lower-cost country, businesses can often save money on the salaries of the developers who will work on your project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using an offshore development team, businesses may \u200creduce or eliminate the need for certain types of infrastructure and support staff in their own office. This can include anything from dedicated server space and IT support to administrative and HR staff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, offshoring also helps take advantage of new technology that would otherwise be too expensive or difficult to implement in the office.

The most common ones are email, chat, and video conferencing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email is the most basic and commonly used tool for communication between organizations. It is quick and easy to use, and can \u200csend messages to multiple people at once.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chat is another common communication tool, which can be used for real-time conversations between two or more people. We often use it for shorter conversations than email, and can be a more informal way of communicating.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video conferencing is a tool that allows two or more people to communicate via webcam. This can be useful for meetings or presentations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hurdles_to_Overcome_In_Hiring_Offshore_Resources\"><\/span><strong>Hurdles to Overcome In Hiring Offshore Resources<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many potential hurdles that companies must overcome when hiring offshore resources. These can include language barriers, cultural differences, time zone differences, and communication difficulties.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies must ensure that their employees are legally allowed to work in the country where they will be based and that they have the \u200cvisas and work permits.

Outsourcing lower-level tasks or processes that don&#8217;t require a high level of expertise can often do this.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Use only the correct resources for the job. Not all offshore resources are equal, and you may find that certain countries or regions offer a higher quality of labor at a lower cost. Do your research and make sure you are getting the most bang for your buck.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Establish good communication channels with your offshore team and make sure everyone is on the same page.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Make sure you have a clear and well-defined project roadmap. This will help ensure everyone agrees and understands the goals of the project.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Establish clear expectations for what each team handles. This will help avoid any confusion or miscommunication between teams.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Clearly define deadlines and make sure everyone is aware of them. This will help ensure that projects stay on track and don&#8217;t get delayed unnecessarily.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Compare the cost of labor in your country with the cost of labor in other countries. If the cost of labor is much lower in another country, it may be more cost-effective to outsource work to that country.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Evaluate the quality of work that you can expect from offshore resources. If you can find a provider who offers high-quality work at a cheap price, it may be worth outsourcing work to that provider.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Top Technologies For Which Companies Prefer Offshore Resources Hiring<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of popular software technologies for which companies often prefer to hire offshore developers. Some of the most common technologies include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud computing technologies<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-platform and hybrid deployment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processes build under Angular, React, NodeJS<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big data computation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile app development<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web development<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ways_to_Identify_the_Best_Company_for_Offshore_Hiring\"><\/span><strong>Ways to Identify the Best Company for Offshore Hiring<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few ways to identify the best company for offshore resources hiring<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25891 size-full\" title=\"Group 186131\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186131.png.webp\" alt=\"Group 186131\" width=\"547\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186131.png.webp 547w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186131.png-300x202.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Group-186131.png-480x324.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Communication_and_Coordination\"><\/span><strong>Communication and Coordination<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure that there is clear and effective communication between the in-house team and the offshore developers. This includes clearly communicating your expectations, goals, and feedback. There should also be a system in place for regular updates and progress reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coordination is another important factor. There should be a clear process for how work will be assigned, how deadlines will be set, and how issues will be resolved. This can help prevent misunderstandings and potential scope creep.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Outsourcing_Rates\"><\/span><strong>Outsourcing Rates<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, it&#8217;s important to understand the point of outsourcing rates. When you outsource your development work, you&#8217;re essentially paying someone else to do the work for you at a lower cost. This can be a great way to save money on your project, but it&#8217;s important to make sure that you&#8217;re comparing apples to apples when assessing different quotes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking to outsource your development, it&#8217;s important to compare pricing models and find the one that best suits your needs. Typically, you can choose between two different models:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Pay Per-Hour Rate<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; This is the most common model, where you pay a developer an hourly rate for their time. This can be a good option if you need a lot of flexibility or if you&#8217;re unsure of how much work will be required. It can also be more expensive in the long run if you go over your budget.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Pay for Milestones <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; With this model, you pay for specific milestones rather than hours worked. This can be more cost-effective in the long run.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Project_Management\"><\/span><strong>Project Management<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best company for offshore developer hiring like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>invertio<\/strong><\/a> will have a robust project management process in place. This process should include requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment. By having a well-defined project management process in place, the company can ensure that the developers they hire are working on the correct tasks and that it keeps all stakeholders informed of progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking for a company to hire offshore developers, it&#8217;s important to find one that has a good project management system in place. This way, you&#8217;ll be able to track the progress of your project and ensure that it&#8217;s on schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project management is essential for ensuring that your project completes on time, within budget, and to your specifications. A good project manager will work with you to create a detailed plan for your project and will then ensure that we complete all aspects of the project on time and within budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some things to look for in a company&#8217;s project management system include:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Clear communication channels between the client and developer team<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Frequent status updates from the developers so you know what&#8217;s been accomplished and what still needs to be done<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Proper documentation of all tasks and procedures, so there is no confusion about what needs to be done or how it should be done<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for everyone involved in the project<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let's Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Transform your business with invertio' reliable and cost-effective offshore software services.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Organic+-+29189-offshore-resource-hiring-guide&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us Today!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Size_of_Organization\"><\/span><strong>Size of Organization<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be difficult to identify the best company for offshore hiring, as there are many factors to consider. One important factor to consider is the size of the organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offshore outsourcing can be a great way to save money and improve efficiency, but it&#8217;s important to work with a company that has the resources and infrastructure in place to handle your project. A large, well-established company will have more experience and expertise in offshore outsourcing than a smaller company. They will also have the bandwidth to take on additional projects without compromising quality or service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re looking for a reliable partner for offshore hiring, look for a company with a proven track record and extensive experience in the industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smaller companies may be more affordable, but they may not have as much experience or resources in place for offshore hiring. It&#8217;s important to do your research before deciding and to ask plenty of questions to make sure you&#8217;re finding the best fit for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Availability_Of_Skilled_Resources_And_Expertise\"><\/span><strong>Availability Of Skilled Resources And Expertise<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the availability of skilled resources, it is important to consider both the current skill set of the developers you are considering and also their future potential. Regarding expertise, you will want to evaluate developers on their \u200cexperience and track record. In both cases, it is important to hire developers who can show they have the right skill set and experience for your project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to identify the best company for offshore developer hiring is therefore to talk to several companies and ask them about their developers&#8217; skillsets and experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few tips for finding the best company for offshore developer hiring:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Look for a company with a strong portfolio of work. This will give you a good indication of their level of expertise and skill.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Make sure they have experience working with clients in your domain.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"IP_and_Data_Security\"><\/span><strong>IP and Data Security<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To hire an offshore developer, it&#8217;s important to identify a company that will provide you with the best possible IP and data security. Here are a few factors to consider when making your decision:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Make sure the company has a robust IP and data security protocol in place. Offshore companies should have clearly defined procedures for handling confidential information. These procedures should be regularly reviewed and updated in response to changes in technology and data security threats.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choose a company that is \u200cin a country with laws that protect your intellectual property rights. Countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia have laws that offer powerful protection for intellectual property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The company&#8217;s staff should be fully trained in data security best practices and regularly updated on new threats and vulnerabilities.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking the time to research potential providers, you can ensure that your intellectual property and sensitive data are well-protected.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let's Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Transform your business with invertio' reliable and cost-effective offshore software services.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Organic+-+29189-offshore-resource-hiring-guide&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us Today!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Project_Delivery_Approach\"><\/span><strong>Project Delivery Approach<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Project Delivery Approach is defined as the way in which a project intended to create or deliver a product, service or result is managed and undertaken by an organization. It includes multiple contractual agreements between a variety of stakeholders, including designers, manufacturers, suppliers, customers and end users. There are three main types of Project Delivery Approaches: Agile,Iterative, and Waterfall.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Knowledge_Retention_Approach\"><\/span><strong>Knowledge Retention Approach<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This approach ensures that the developer has a good understanding of your company&#8217;s unique knowledge domain and can apply it to his work. Without this approach, developers may not be able to properly adapt their skills and experience to your company&#8217;s needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to find out if a developer has a good understanding of the Knowledge Retention Approach is to ask them about it during the interview process. If they&#8217;re able to explain it clearly and show how they would use it in their work, then you can be confident that they&#8217;ll be able to do a great job for your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The knowledge retention approach is based on ensuring that crucial project requirements and details are accurately conveyed to, and understood by, the team carrying out the work. To do this, an organization or individual first needs to understand what needs to be accomplished. They will also need to have excellent communication skills in order to explain the project requirements to those who will work on it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_invertio_Makes_The_Best_Company_For_Offshore_Hiring\"><\/span><strong>How invertio Makes The Best Company For Offshore Hiring?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invertio makes the best company for offshore hiring as we satisfy all these requirements as mentioned below:<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We have a rigorous selection process and only choose the best developers for the process.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We provide complete transparency to our clients with regards to the developers&#8217; skill sets, hourly rates, and project progress reports.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We have a team of dedicated project managers who ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Our developers are experts in a range of technologies, including Java, .NET, PHP, iOS, Android, and Ruby on Rails.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee or your money back.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring offshore resources is not only cheaper but also fast.
