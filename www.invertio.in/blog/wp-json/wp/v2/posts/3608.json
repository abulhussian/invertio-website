It requires constant attention and focuses on what will keep them interested in your brand. It requires how you can engage with their needs or interests long-term. In this way, they become loyal patrons of yours instead of someone who spends time elsewhere doing business (sleepless nights).<\/p>\n<p>Data analysis helps identify those people who disengage by identifying patterns. An example of this includes frequent buying habits. These insights give retailers insight into introducing offers that may interest the customer to make purchases again while retaining current ones.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Related Post: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/applications-of-big-data-marketing-analytics\/\" rel=\"bookmark\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Applications of Big Data Marketing Analytics<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Real-Time_Use_Cases_Of_Big_Data_Analytics_In_the_Retail_Industry\"><\/span>Real-Time Use Cases Of Big Data Analytics In the Retail Industry<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>1.
