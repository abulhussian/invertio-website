User Adoption To Boost Market Reach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of application support and maintenance services and up-gradation can make your app outdated; this may impact the app&#8217;s user adoption rate. Nowadays, users just prefer using the modernized version of the application and software.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So to make your app more extraordinary, focus on adopting the concepts that users require today; this will profit in enhancing user experience and user adoption rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the business will not center on the App Maintenance part, the business cannot meet users&#8217; desires, ultimately resulting in a waning number of users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, from 2006 to 2010, Orkut&#8217;s name was quite popular. All users liked this social media platform, but it&#8217;s fame was sustainable for a precise time frame due to the absence of maintenance. So note if you need to maintain the app popularity level, focus on the app updation and maintenance part.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Wrapping_It_Up\"><\/span><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Wrapping It Up<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No legacy can go forever; it&#8217;s essential to know when to update or upgrade.
