You need to be able to track your progress and make changes accordingly. This is where business intelligence comes in. BI allows you to collect, analyze, and report on data in order to make better decisions for your company.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There have been some major changes in the business intelligence landscape in the past five years.
