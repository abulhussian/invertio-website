The team started this project to develop a language for digital devices such as receivers, televisions, etc. Originally, it was considered that C ++ was used in the project, but the idea was rejected for several reasons (for example, C ++ requires more memory).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gosling sought to change and expand C ++ but soon gave it up to do another phase called Green. The project was named \u201cGreentalk\u201d by James Gosling and his team. Its file extension was .gt, and later it became known as \u201cOAK.\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Oak\"><\/span><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Why Oak?<\/strong><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gosling used the name Oak in honor of an oak that left his office. Besides, Oak is a solidarity image and has been chosen as the national tree of many countries such as the United States, France, Germany, Romania, etc. Still, then they had to rename it as \u2018Java\u2019 because it was already a registered trademark of Oak Technologies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, Gosling and his team had a brainstorming session, and after the session, they came up with various names like Java, DNA, SILK, RUBY, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name Java has been determined after much discussion because it is so unique. The name Java comes from a type of espresso, Java. Gosling came up with that name idea while having coffee near his office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Java has been built according to principles like robust, portable, platform-independent, high performance, multi-threaded, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1992 Java turned out very useful for developing software for portable and handheld devices such as pagers, mobile phones, etc. By the end of 1992, Java became very popular on the Internet for creating graphics applications and games.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From then till now, Java thrived as a major programming language for standalone application development and programming language for <\/span><strong><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><a style=\"color: #003366;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/web-application-development\">web application development<\/a><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with JSP and servlet.
