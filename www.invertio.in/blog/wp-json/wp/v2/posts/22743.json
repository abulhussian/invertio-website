This bytecode is executed by a virtual machine, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), instead of direct interpretation at runtime.<\/li>\n<li><strong>JVM Compatibility:<\/strong> The JVM can execute code written in Java or other JVM-compliant languages, such as Scala and Clojure. This compatibility opens doors for advanced development projects, especially those focused on performance optimization.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Language Interchangeability<\/strong>: Java app development isn&#8217;t limited to Java alone. Languages like Scala and Clojure, which compile to run on the JVM, can be seamlessly integrated into Java projects.
