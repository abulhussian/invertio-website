With a tight budget, you need to think about numerous things like application security, user-friendliness, developer cost, and many more. This is why you should go for an established platform like Python, which not only frees you from your constraints but brings you a number of business benefits. Moreover, Python development gives you the freedom for future upgrades as it can interact easily with other languages.<\/p>\n<p>Before discussing in detail business benefits, let&#8217;s revisit the basics of this language. Python is a high-level OOPs-based, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that doesn&#8217;t repeat itself and mainly focuses on rapid application development. Its design philosophy emphasizes the readability of the code, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C. The language provides constructs designed to allow clear programs on both small and large scales.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/details\/pl-python\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">W3Techs<\/a>, Python is used by 0.2% of all websites.
