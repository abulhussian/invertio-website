This toolkit can speed up and enhance cross-platform app development. This beta release builds amazing native apps for businesses and is also a powering experimental Fuchsia OS.<\/p>\n<p>Flutter Beta release, announced at Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, brings a more refined version of the SDK(Software development kit) to developers as compared to its alpha release which got released last year. The toolkit acts as a layer of middleware, allowing the developers to create code that can be run on a variety of different operating systems, extending the application&#8217;s reach to multiple platforms. It has claimed to offer its developers a source to build high-quality native interfaces for both iOS and Android.<\/p>\n<p>However, Flutter is being used in various major projects of Google. In fact, Fuchsia OS is built on Flutter and apps like AdWords are using the open source framework to prove its success. With its new release, it has become a handy UI solution for developers in order to build cross-platform apps. This beta release works well with a pre-release version of Dart 2 language and also includes support for declaring UI within the code along with minimal language ceremony.<\/p>\n<h3>It has come up with the following features:<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8245\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1152\" height=\"671\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui.jpg.webp 1720w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui-300x175.jpg.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui.jpg-768x447.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui.jpg-1024x597.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui.jpg-1536x895.webp 1536w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui.jpg-480x280.webp 480w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui-600x350.jpg.webp 600w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ui-960x559.jpg.webp 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p>&#8211; Platform interop which will expose the power of mobile platforms to Flutter code<br \/>\n&#8211; New refactoring feature to help developers in managing their widget code.<br \/>\n&#8211; Improved stateful hot reloads<br \/>\n&#8211; New widget inspector which provides an easy view to browse the entire widget tree.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Related Blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/industry-news\/googles-flutter-beta-builds-beautiful-native-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top Android App Development Trends To Look For<\/a><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Google has also highlighted the three major benefits of using Flutter for your mobile app development. These are mentioned below:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>1) Expressive and flexible designs<\/strong> with composible widget sets, rich animation libraries, and a layered, extensible architecture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) High-velocity development<\/strong> which provides new features, rich widget set, reactive framework and integrated tooling.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8243\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/high-velcity.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"878\" height=\"522\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/flutter.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flutter<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>3) High-quality experiences<\/strong> cross devices and platform with built-in GPU-accelerated renderer and native ARM code runtime and platform interop.<\/p>\n<p>So, developers now don&#8217;t have to stick only to Android development as Flutter offers a unified solution for apps supporting multiple platforms. It also has the ability to transform the experience from one platform to another by changing the behaviour of the scroll, buttons, sliders, dialog boxes and switches, among others, from the Android Material Design standards to the Cupertino iOS.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Google is expected to detail the new features of Flutter in its I\/O 2018 later this year. The same I\/O location could be used to reveal certain information about the Fuchsia operating system.<\/p>\n<h3>To get more clear of Flutter Beta, you can also check out the following video:<\/h3>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The popularity of Flutter is on the rise due to its incredible features.
