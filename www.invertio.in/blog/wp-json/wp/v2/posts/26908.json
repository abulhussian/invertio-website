A company hires and takes advantage of employees&#8217; talent from an outside staffing firm that focuses on providing services to meet your company&#8217;s needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a few key differences between IT staff augmentation and outsourcing set them apart. Outsourcing can be more cost effective because you only pay for what you need when needed, but it\u2019s not as customizable or personalized as <\/span>IT Staff Augmentation.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As organizations struggle to keep up with technological innovations and adapt to new practices, it&#8217;s not surprising that IT staffing needs are constantly changing. Keeping up-to-date on new technologies and finding professionals with the right skills to work at your company can be daunting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, there are many ways in which you can meet your staffing needs while ensuring those workers stay satisfied and engaged in their roles. One of the most effective methods is IT staff augmentation.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Get IT Staff Augmentation Benefits Guide<\/div>\n    <p>Get a step-by-step<br \/>\nguide to know how IT Staff Augmentation benefits for tech companies. <\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"_triggerEbook();\" class=\"banner-btn\" target=\"_self\">Download Now<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_of_Staff_Augmentation\"><\/span>Types of Staff Augmentation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many IT staff augmentations are available, we can categorize them into three types. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of each category:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Commodity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: These are staff augmentation tasks that freelance contractors can easily and quickly handle. A quick search for a freelancer will turn up dozens of qualified candidates within minutes. There is usually no interview process to find the perfect person for the job. If you have one-time projects and need someone on your team to complete them, commodity staff augmentation is perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Non-commodity:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Non-commodity IT staff augmentation tasks are more in-depth and require skills or knowledge that are hard to find. If you\u2019re looking for a specialized skill set, such as someone who knows how to design websites, you\u2019ll probably have to conduct an extensive search, even if it means hiring someone full-time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Skill-based<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Skill-based staffing is used when a business needs to fill an open position with a skill set it doesn&#8217;t currently have on its payroll. There are often high barriers to entry for these positions because these skills are hard to find, so staffing agencies may require potential employees to take tests or prove their qualifications before being considered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Highly Skilled<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: High-skilled staff augmentation falls into short-term and long-term categories. Short-term is what it sounds like, workers who come in for short periods (often weeks) while your regular team takes a vacation. Long-term hires typically stay on your payroll full-time, but you cannot handle 100% of their workload. They work as support while your regular team handles the heavier stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let's Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Looking to increase productivity and reduce costs?

When staff augmentation is in place, your company will be more productive because it&#8217;s free from responsibilities that take up valuable time and energy.<br \/>\nThese IT staff augmentation services come in many flavors, but the common denominator among them is the type of commitment they provide to the customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can hire either onsite or remote employees. Both have advantages and disadvantages, depending on your business needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Onsite staff augmentation means working with IT support professionals in your company&#8217;s office space. It gives them a direct line of sight into what&#8217;s happening with your network and your technology infrastructure to address the issues quickly and immediately.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote staff augmentation means they work from another location outside of your office space, usually at home or in a co-working facility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Onsite staff augmentation is more expensive, but it gives you direct access to your support professionals. You can also choose when and how you would like to have their assistance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With remote staff augmentation, IT services are cheaper overall because there is no cost associated with office space or equipment that a contractor must use. However, these workers often require more oversight because they aren&#8217;t sitting in front of your company&#8217;s network daily.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/top-7-it-staff-augmentation-service-companies\/?utm_source=Organic+-+invertio&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 20 IT Staff Augmentation Service Companies<\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Are_The_Benefits_of_IT_Staff_Augmentation\"><\/span><strong>What Are The Benefits of IT Staff Augmentation?\u00a0<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33869\" title=\"Benefits of IT Staff Augmentation\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Benefits-of-IT-Staff-Augmentation.png.webp\" alt=\"Benefits of IT Staff Augmentation\" width=\"800\" height=\"677\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Benefits-of-IT-Staff-Augmentation.png.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Benefits-of-IT-Staff-Augmentation.png-300x254.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Benefits-of-IT-Staff-Augmentation.png-768x650.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Benefits-of-IT-Staff-Augmentation.png-480x406.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many companies these days face the problem of being unable to keep up with technology.

Outsourcing providers allow your organization to utilize this increased availability with little overhead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IT staffing companies can provide you with highly skilled &amp; experienced resources who know how to work with your systems and processes. Additionally, they can be contracted to bring on temporary staff when significant workload increases. This gives you an agile technology team that is uniquely qualified to tackle projects of all sizes and scopes and allows you to concentrate on running your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Business_Functions_Will_You_Outsource\"><\/span><strong>What Business Functions Will You Outsource?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When outsourcing IT functions, it is important to start with the tasks that will have the least impact on your current staff&#8217;s workload. But what if you need help from outside companies to understand which IT services are best for your company? Consider asking for a free consultation from invertio Consultants.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine which <\/span>IT Staff Augmentation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solutions will have minimal impact on your current staffing. Look at projects that don&#8217;t need to complete immediately or tasks that can be delayed. Your outsourcing provider should have no trouble helping you identify and prioritize which applications you should handle internally vs. which ones you should outsource.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The distinction is easier when your company only has a few IT personnel and there aren&#8217;t any pressing needs for new software or hardware. For example, outsourcing services make sense if your business doesn&#8217;t need video conferencing equipment until your needs change and expand.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next is to make sure you always have an outside contractor to fall back on. This allows you to keep things under control in your business and take advantage of outsourcing when it makes sense for your company.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you need help installing a new database management system, you can contact an IT Staff Augmentation provider for assistance. Afterward, go back to handling database management internally by leveraging a remote cloud database server from Amazon Web Services (AWS).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to research your options carefully and find an IT staff augmentation provider that you feel confident in. Each outsourcing agreement is unique, but all of them should offer a contract where you have complete control over when your company is on call for support and what happens when that time comes. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re looking for an <\/span>IT Staff Augmentation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provider to support your business now and in the future, ValueCoder may be a good fit.\u00a0 We have assisted enterprises, startups, and SMEs with their digital transformation for over a decade.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let's Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Looking to increase productivity and reduce costs?

A Complete Guide<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Budget_of_IT_Staff_Augmentation\"><\/span><strong>Budget of IT Staff Augmentation<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The standard model of providing IT services is an in-house IT department. This is a larger expense, as the company must set aside more funds to cover staff salaries and equipment upkeep. However, this can lead to savings in other areas of business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a company must rely on outsourced contractors without in-house IT staff when disaster strikes. Contractors come at an increased cost and often lack the efficiency and knowledge that an experienced in-house IT staff member might offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The outsourcing model involves hiring a third-party IT firm to handle your company\u2019s IT needs, including installing new equipment, providing repair and support services, and offering advice on improving your system. Outsourcing is less expensive than an in-house option. Many IT companies offer package deals that combine hardware maintenance and software support for a single fee.<\/p>\n<p>However, deciding your budget or taking stock of all your current expenses is essential before selecting a service model. Start by counting how much you spend on IT currently. If you haven\u2019t used outsourcing yet, determine how much you would be charged per hour for these services. Next, consider if increased or decreased support will benefit your business more to save time and money for future projects.<\/p>\n<p>Based on your needs and project workload, this may make more sense for one company than another. Knowing where you stand financially can help ensure that choosing a new IT service model is an investment rather than a cost. With so many considerations to think about, narrowing down which one will work best for your organization can seem daunting. But anyone can find the right fit with careful planning and guidance from industry experts.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"IT Staff Augmentation Explained: How It Work And Benefits in 2025 - invertio\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/BbhUZyu2F4Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Things_To_Ensure_Before_IT_Staff_Augmentation\"><\/span><strong>Things To Ensure Before IT Staff Augmentation<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ll need to have each contractor on your team sign a non-disclosure agreement so that you can remain confident in the work your<\/span> IT Staff Augmentation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">company is doing. In addition, include language in your contracts stating that any code or design created by outside contractors will belong to you and not them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you may include a clause prohibiting IT staff augmentation team members from working for competing companies. And you&#8217;ll want to make sure they sign an NDA when they work on your project so that you don&#8217;t end up with a competitor using your intellectual property.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ll also want to ensure that their contract states that all codes and designs created by outside contractors are yours, not theirs. And it&#8217;s always good practice to add a clause banning IT staff augmentation employees from working for competing firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have everything in writing, you can start hiring. Start your search by requesting references from your friends, business partners, and colleagues. You&#8217;ll likely be able to find local contractors through personal referrals as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That way, if someone asks where you found an IT staff augmentation team member who did great work for you, they can refer more business to that person, which means more work for them!<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/how-is-it-staff-augmentation-a-unique-talent-option-for-the-startups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Is IT Staff Augmentation A Unique Talent Option For The Startups?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Get_Started_With_IT_Augmentation\"><\/span>How to Get Started With IT Augmentation?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you&#8217;ve a sense of how<\/span> IT Staff Augmentation Services <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work, it&#8217;s time to evaluate the options.

To ensure you&#8217;re working with a reputable company, run background checks on their employees (although it&#8217;s probably best not to go overboard here), talk with other clients, and ask about their experiences working with that provider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you work with an offshore provider, you must write your agreement and establish expectations from both sides. Many service providers offer contract templates, so you can use that as a starting point when drafting your agreement. While they may look intimidating at first glance, they&#8217;re typically straightforward once you break them down.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a standard contract doesn&#8217;t address your needs, \u200cwork with an attorney or service provider who can draft something more comprehensive that addresses any unique issues specific to your business and industry. You should also outline any special terms regarding pricing or payment within the contract itself to avoid misunderstandings down the line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invertio is dedicated to providing top-quality services that enhance business productivity and profitability at <\/span>IT Staff Augmentation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
