In fact, smartphone users enjoy the same browsing experience as their desktop\/laptop base peers.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s world, there is a huge craze for mobile web and application development. It is because of the user base, which is growing at a phenomenal rate.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in the coming years, mobile-based Internet usage would overshadow traditional desktop\/laptop browsing. HTML5 has emerged as the front-runner in the race when it comes to mobile development.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Let us take a closer look at some reasons why this markup language is useful for mobile development<\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>HLML5 helps developers to generate cleaner and consistent codes. They use HTML5 across multiple platforms by default. This means the same codes are applied across platforms such as iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, etc. Therefore, it saves development costs and helps businesses target a large customer base.<\/li>\n<li>HTML5 allows developers to create highly responsive websites. It can further detect the devices which are already browsed with and render a version of the website on the basis of the browser, screen resolution, and screen size. Thus, all users get a wholesome browsing experience, irrespective of the device they use to browse the website.<\/li>\n<li>Along with HTML5, the developers also make use of CSS3 styles. CSS3 based animation reduces the size of the app, which improves the speed of the application and puts less load on the mobile processor. Thereby improving the overall performance of the device.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Read More: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/10-top-web-development-frameworks-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20 Top Web Development Frameworks (Updated List 2022)<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li>This technology has taken web development to the next level with the help of support for geolocation services. This basically tracks the location of a user and offers solutions as per the locations. For example, if you are looking for a gas station, the search results would offer you results of gas stations near your place.<\/li>\n<li>In today&#8217;s time, Audio and video components are in great demand and use for modern websites. With HTML5, you can easily integrate rich audio and video media via native code only. You won\u2019t have to make use of Flash or Silver light to run videos on the mobile website.<\/li>\n<li>It has advanced from input types using browsers. This can handle more information, allowing the users to browse more. Moreover, it takes less time in downloading JavaScript code. It also cuts down the number of round trips to the server. In this way, you can achieve validation before the form is posted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=html5formob_1049&amp;utm_campaign=webblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21823\" src=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-app-development.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-app-development.jpg.webp 810w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-app-development.jpg-300x56.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-app-development.jpg-768x144.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.invertio.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-app-development.jpg-480x90.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Mobile development using HTML5 needs high levels of skills and expertise on the part of the developer, and you should always be choosy in outsourcing your project.
